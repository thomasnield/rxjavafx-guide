# 2. RxJava Fundamentals

RxJava has two core types: the `Observable` and the `Subscriber`. In the simplest definition, an **Observable** *pushes* things. For a given `Observable<T>`, it will push items of type `T` through a series of operators that form other Observables, and finally the **Subscriber** is what consumes the items at the end of the chain.

Each pushed `T` item is known as an **emission**. Usually there is a finite number of emissions, but sometimes there can be an infinite number of emissions. An emission can represent either data or an event (or both!). This is where the power of reactive programming differentiates itself from Java 8 Streams and Kotlin Sequences. It has a notion of *emissions over time*, and we will explore these ideas in this chapter. 

If you have decent experience with RxJava already, you are welcome to skip this chapter. In later chapters you may encounter RxJAva concepts that are already familiar, but be sure to not skip these as these concepts are introduced from a JavaFX perspective. 

## The `Observable` and `Subscriber`

As stated earlier, an **Observable** pushes things. It pushes things of type `T` through a series of operators forming other `Observables`.  Each pushed item is known as an **emission**. Those emissions are pushed all the way to a `Subscriber` where they are finally consumed. 

You will need to create a **source Observable** where emissions originate from, and there are many factories to do this. To create a source `Observable` that pushes items 1 through 5, declare the following: 

**Java**

```java 
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
```

This source `Observable<Integer>` is saved to a variable named `source`. However, it has not pushed anything yet. In order to start pushing emissions, you need to create a `Subscriber`. The quickest way to do this is call `subscribe()` and pass a lambda specifying what to do with each emission. 

**Java**

```java 
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
source.subscribe { println(it) }
```

A **lambda** is a special type of argument specifying an instruction. The lambda above will take each emission and print it, and this is turned into a `Subscriber`. 

>Java 8 and Kotlin have their own ways of expressing lambdas. If you need to learn more about Java 8 lambdas, I would recommend reading at least the first two chapters of [*Java 8 Lambdas*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do) by Richard Warburton before proceeding. You can read the [Kotlin Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html) to learn about lambdas in Kotlin. Lambdas are a very critical syntax feature and you should be familiar with it before moving further. 

Go ahead and run the code above in a test or `main()` method, and you should get the following:

**OUTPUT:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

You can specify up to three lambda arguments on the `subscribe()` method to not only handle each emission, but also to handle the event of an error as well as specify an action when emissions are complete.

**Java**
```java
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
                e -> e.printStackTrace(),
                () -> System.out.println("Done!")
        );
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

source.subscribeWith {
    onNext { println(it) }
    onError { it.printStackTrace() }
    onCompleted { println("Done!") }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
Done!
```

Let's briefly break down the `Subscriber` to understand it better. The lambdas are just a shortcut to allow the `subscribe()` method to quickly create a `Subscriber` for you. You can create your own `Subscriber` object explicitly by extending and implementing its three abstract methods: `onNext()`, `onError()`, and `onCompleted()`.  You can then pass this `Subscriber` to the `subscribe()` method directly.

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);

Subscriber<Integer> subscriber = new Subscriber<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer integer) {
        System.out.println(integer);
    }
};

source.subscribe(subscriber);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

val subscriber = object: Subscriber<Int>() {
    override fun onCompleted() = println("Done!")

    override fun onNext(t: Int) = println(t)

    override fun onError(e: Throwable) = e.printStackTrace()
}

source.subscribe(subscriber)
```


The `Subscriber`  actually implements the `Observer` interface which defines these three methods. The `onNext()` is what is called to pass an emission. The `onError()` is called when there is an error, and `onCompleted()` is called when there are no more emissions. Logically with infinite Observables, the `onCompleted()` is never called. 

These three methods on the `Observer` are very critical for understanding RxJava, and we will revisit them continuously in this chapter. Although it is helpful for understanding the `Subscriber`, creating your own `Subscriber` objects can be pretty verbose, so it is helpful to use lambdas instead for conciseness. 

Going back to the source `Observable`, there are other factories to create them. Above we emitted the integers 1 through 5. Since these are consecutive, we can use `Observable.range()` to accomplish the same thing. It will emit the numbers 1 through 5 based on their range, and then call `onComplete()`. 

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
```

You can also turn any `Collection` into an `Observable` quickly using `Observable.from()`. It will emit all items in that `Collection` and then call `onComplete()` when it is done. 

**Java**
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.from(list);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val list = listOf(1,2,3,4,5)
val source = Observable.from(list)
```

## Using Operators

Let's do something a little more useful than just connecting a source `Observable` and a `Subscriber`. Let's put some operators between them. 

### map()

Say you have an `Observable<String>` that pushes `String` values. 

**Java**
```java
Observable<String> source = 
    Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source =  Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
```

In RxJava, you can use hundreds of operators to transform emissions and create new Observables with those transformations. For instance, you can create an `Observable<Integer>` off an `Observable<String>` by using the `map()` operator, which can emit each String's length. 

**Java**
```java
Observable<String> source = 
    Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");

Observable<Integer> lengths = source.map(s -> s.length());

lengths.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source =  Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")

val lengths = source.map { it.length }

lengths.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**
```
5
4
5
5
7
```

The `source` Observable pushes each `String` to the `map()` operator where it is mapped to its `length()`. That length is then pushed from the `map()` operator to the `Subscriber` where it is printed. 

You can do all of this without any intermediary variables to save each `Observable`, and instead do everything in a single "chain" call. You can do it all in one line or break it up into multiple lines. 

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.source.map(s -> s.length())
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map { it.length }
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```


### filter()

Another common operator is `filter()`, which suppresses emissions that fail to meet a certain criteria, and pushes the ones that do forward. For instance, you can emit only Strings where the `length()` is at least 5.  In this case, the `filter()` will stop "Beta" from proceeding since it is 4 charactes.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.filter(s -> s.length() >= 5)
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.filter { it.length() >= 5 }
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**
```
Alpha
Gamma
Delta
Epsilon
```

### distinct()

There are also operators like `distinct()`, which will suppress emissions that have previously been emitted (based on each emission's `hashcode()`/`equals()` implementation).  


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.source.map(s -> s.length())
	.distinct()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map { it.length }
	.distinct()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
5
4
7
```

### take()

The `take()` operator will allow a fixed number of emissions and then unsubscribe from the source. Then it will call `onCompleted()` down the rest of the chain. 


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.take(3)
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.take(3)
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Alpha
Beta
Gamma
```

`takeWhile()` and `takeUntil()` do something similar to `take()`, but specify a condition to determine when to stop taking emissions rather than a fixed count. 

### count()

Some operators will aggregate the emissions in some form, and then push that aggregation as a single emission when it is done. 

Obviously, this requires the `onCompleted()` to be called so that the aggregation can be finalized and pushed to the `Subscriber`. 

One of these aggregation operators is `count()`. It will simply count the number of emissions and when its`onCompleted()` is called, it will push the count up to the `Subscriber` as a single emission. Then it will call `onCompleted()` up to the `Subscriber`. 


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.count()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.count()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
5
```

### toList()

The `toList()` is similar to the `count()`. It will collect the emissions until its `onCompleted()` is called. After that it will push an entire `List` containing all the emissions to the `Subscriber`. 

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.toList()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.toList()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
[Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon]
```

Like using `count()`, the `toList()` will misbehave on infinite Observables because collections can only be finite, and it needs that `onCompleted()` to be called to push the `List` forward. Otherwise it will collect and work infinitely. 

### flatMap()

There are [hundreds of operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html) in RxJava, but we will only cover one more for now. Throughout the book we will learn more as we go, and the most effective way to learn operators is to look for them as you need them. 

The `flatMap()` is similar to `map()`, but you map the emission to another set of emissions via another `Observable`. This is one of the most powerful operators in RxJava and it is full of use cases especially with hot Observables, which we will cover later in this chapter. For now let's just stick with a simple example. 

Say we wave some emissions where each one contains some concatenated numbers separated by a slash `/`. Say we wanted to break these numbers up into separate emissions (and omit the slashes). You can call `split()` on each`String` and  specify splitting it on the slash `/`, and this will return an array of the separated`String` values. Then  you can turn that array into an `Observable` inside the `flatMap()`. 

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("123/52/6345","23421/534","758/2341/74932")
		.flatMap(s -> Observable.from(s.split("/")))
		.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("123/52/6345","23421/534","758/2341/74932")
         .flatMap { it.split(Regex("/")).toObservable() }
         .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
123
52
6345
23421
534
758
2341
74932
```

If you observe this closely, hopefully you will  find the `flatMap()` is pretty straightforward, and it is.You are taking each emission and replacing it with another set of emissions, through another `Observable`. There is a lot of very powerful ways to leverage the `flatMap()`, and we will see it in different flavors throughout this book.
