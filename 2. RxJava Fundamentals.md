# 2. RxJava Fundamentals

RxJava has two core types: the `Observable` and the `Subscriber`. In the simplest definition, an `Observable` *pushes* things. For a given `Observable<T>`, it will push items of type `T` through a series of operators that form other Observables, and finally the `Subscriber` is what consumes the items at the end of the chain.

Each pushed `T` item is known as an **emission**. Usually there is a finite number of emissions, but sometimes there can be infinite. An emission can represent either data or an event (or both!). This is where the power of reactive programming differentiates itself from Java 8 Streams and Kotlin Sequences. It has a notion of *emissions over time*, and we will explore this concept in this chapter.

If you have decent experience with RxJava already, you are welcome to skip this chapter. In later chapters you may encounter RxJava concepts that are already familiar, but be sure to not skip these as these concepts are often introduced from a JavaFX perspective.

## The `Observable` and `Subscriber`

As stated earlier, an **Observable** pushes things. It pushes things of type `T` through a series of operators forming other `Observables`.  Each pushed item is known as an **emission**. Those emissions are pushed all the way to a `Subscriber` where they are finally consumed.

You will need to create a **source Observable** where emissions originate from, and there are many factories to do this. To create a source `Observable` that pushes items 1 through 5, declare the following:

**Java**

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
```

This source `Observable<Integer>` is saved to a variable named `source`. However, it has not pushed anything yet. In order to start pushing emissions, you need to create a `Subscriber`. The quickest way to do this is call `subscribe()` and pass a lambda specifying what to do with each emission.

**Java**

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
source.subscribe { println(it) }
```

A **lambda** is a special type of argument specifying an instruction. This one will take each emission and print it, and this `subscribe()` operation creates a `Subscriber`.

>Java 8 and Kotlin have their own ways of expressing lambdas. If you need to learn more about Java 8 lambdas, I would recommend reading at least the first two chapters of [*Java 8 Lambdas*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do) by Richard Warburton before proceeding. You can read the [Kotlin Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html) to learn about lambdas in Kotlin. Lambdas are a very critical and concise syntax feature that we will use constantly in this book.

Go ahead and run the code above in a test or `main()` method, and you should get the following:

**OUTPUT:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Understandings Subscribers and Observers

You can specify up to three lambda arguments on the `subscribe()` method to not only handle each emission, but also handle the event of an error as well as specify an action when there are no more emissions.

**Java**
```java
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
                e -> e.printStackTrace(),
                () -> System.out.println("Done!")
        );
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

source.subscribeWith {
    onNext { println(it) }
    onError { it.printStackTrace() }
    onCompleted { println("Done!") }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
Done!
```

>Typically, you should always supply an `onError()` lambda to your `subscribe()` call so errors do not quietly go unhandled. We will not use `onError()` very much in this book for the sake of brevity, but be sure to use it when putting reactive code in production.

Let's briefly break down the `Subscriber` to understand it better. The lambdas are just a shortcut to allow the `subscribe()` method to quickly create a `Subscriber` for you. You can create your own `Subscriber` object explicitly by extending and implementing its three abstract methods: `onNext()`, `onError()`, and `onCompleted()`.  You can then pass this `Subscriber` to the `subscribe()` method.

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);

Subscriber<Integer> subscriber = new Subscriber<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer integer) {
        System.out.println(integer);
    }
};

source.subscribe(subscriber);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

val subscriber = object: Subscriber<Int>() {
    override fun onCompleted() = println("Done!")

    override fun onNext(i: Int) = println(i)

    override fun onError(e: Throwable) = e.printStackTrace()
}

source.subscribe(subscriber)
```


The `Subscriber`  actually implements the `Observer` interface which defines these three methods. The `onNext()` is what is called to pass an emission. The `onError()` is called when there is an error, and `onCompleted()` is called when there are no more emissions. Logically with infinite Observables, the `onCompleted()` is never called.

Although it is helpful for understanding the `Subscriber`, creating your own `Subscriber` objects can be pretty verbose, so it is helpful to use lambdas instead for conciseness.


> It is critical to note that the `onNext()` can only be called by one thread at a time. There should never be multiple threads calling `onNext()` concurrently, and we will learn more about this later when we cover concurrency. For now just note RxJava has no notion of parallelization, and when you subscribe to a factory like `Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)`, you will always get those emissions serially and in that exact order *on a single thread*.

These three methods on the `Observer` are critical for understanding RxJava, and we will revisit them several times in this chapter.


## Source Observable Factories


Going back to the source `Observable`, there are other factories to create source Observables. Above we emitted the integers 1 through 5. Since these are consecutive, we can use `Observable.range()` to accomplish the same thing. It will emit the numbers 1 through 5 based on their range, and then call `onComplete()`.

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
```

You can also turn any `Collection` into an `Observable` quickly using `Observable.from()`. It will emit all items in that `Collection` and then call `onComplete()` when it is done.

**Java**
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.from(list);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val list = listOf(1,2,3,4,5)
val source = Observable.from(list)
```

## Using Operators

Let's do something a little more useful than just connecting a source `Observable` and a `Subscriber`. Let's put some operators between them to actually transform emissions and do work.

### map()

Say you have an `Observable<String>` that pushes `String` values.

**Java**
```java
Observable<String> source =
    Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source =  Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
```

In RxJava, you can use hundreds of operators to transform emissions and create new Observables with those transformations. For instance, you can create an `Observable<Integer>` off an `Observable<String>` by using the `map()` operator, and use it to emit each String's length.

**Java**
```java
Observable<String> source =
    Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");

Observable<Integer> lengths = source.map(s -> s.length());

lengths.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source =  Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")

val lengths = source.map { it.length }

lengths.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**
```
5
4
5
5
7
```

The `source` Observable pushes each `String` to the `map()` operator where it is mapped to its `length()`. That length is then pushed from the `map()` operator to the `Subscriber` where it is printed.

You can do all of this without any intermediary variables holding each `Observable`, and instead do everything in a single "chain" call. This can be done all in one line or broken up into multiple lines.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map(s -> s.length())
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map { it.length }
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

Operators behave as both an intermediary `Subscriber` and an `Observable`, receiving emissions from the source up the chain, and after doing some transformations it will pass those emissions down the chain to the declared`Subscriber`.

```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon") // calls onNext() on map()
	.map(s -> s.length()) // calls onNext() on Subscriber
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

### filter()

Another common operator is `filter()`, which suppresses emissions that fail to meet a certain criteria, and pushes the ones that do forward. For instance, you can emit only Strings where the `length()` is at least 5.  In this case, the `filter()` will stop "Beta" from proceeding since it is 4 characters.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.filter(s -> s.length() >= 5)
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.filter { it.length() >= 5 }
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**
```
Alpha
Gamma
Delta
Epsilon
```

### distinct()

There are also operators like `distinct()`, which will suppress emissions that have previously been emitted to prevent duplicate emissions (based on each emission's `hashcode()`/`equals()` implementation).


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map(s -> s.length())
	.distinct()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.map { it.length }
	.distinct()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
5
4
7
```

You can also provide a lambda specifying an attribute of each emitted item to distinct on, rather than the item itself.


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.distinct(s -> s.length())
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.distinct { it.length }
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Alpha
Beta
Epsilon
```

### take()

The `take()` operator will cut off at a fixed number of emissions and then unsubscribe from the source. Afterwards, it will call `onCompleted()` down the rest of the chain.


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.take(3)
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.take(3)
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Alpha
Beta
Gamma
```

`takeWhile()` and `takeUntil()` do something similar to `take()`, but specify a lambda condition to determine when to stop taking emissions rather than using a fixed count.

### count()

Some operators will aggregate the emissions in some form, and then push that aggregation as a single emission to the `Subscriber`. Obviously, this requires the `onCompleted()` to be called so that the aggregation can be finalized and pushed to the `Subscriber`.

One of these aggregation operators is `count()`. It will simply count the number of emissions and when its `onCompleted()` is called, it will push the count up to the `Subscriber` as a single emission. Then it will call `onCompleted()` up to the `Subscriber`.


**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.count()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.count()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
5
```

### toList()

The `toList()` is similar to the `count()`. It will collect the emissions until its `onCompleted()` is called. After that it will push an entire `List` containing all the emissions to the `Subscriber`.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.toList()
	.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
	.toList()
	.subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
[Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon]
```

Aggregate operators like `toList()` will misbehave on infinite Observables because collections can only be finite, and it needs that `onCompleted()` to be called to push the `List` forward. Otherwise it will collect and work infinitely.

### reduce() and scan()

When you need to do a custom aggregation, you can use `reduce()` to achieve this in most cases (to aggregate into collections, you can use its cousin `collect()`). But say we wanted the sum of all lengths for all emissions. Started with a seed value of zero, we can use a lambda specifying how to "fold" the emissions into a single value.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
     .map(s -> s.length())
     .reduce(0,(l1,l2) -> l1 + l2)
     .subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
        .map { it.length }
        .reduce(0) { l1,l2 -> l1 + l2 }
        .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
26
```

The lambda in `reduce()` will keep adding two `Integer` values (where one of them is the "rolling total" or seed `0` value, and the other is the new value to be added). As soon as `onCompleted()` is called, it will push the result to the `Subscriber`.

The `reduce()` will push a single aggregated value derived from all the emissions. If you want to push the "running total" for each emission, you can use `scan()` instead. This can work with infinite Observables since it will push each accumulation for each emission, rather than waiting for all emissions to be accumulated.

**Java**
```java
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
     .map(s -> s.length())
	   .scan(0,(l1,l2) -> l1 + l2)
     .subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
        .map { it.length }
        .scan(0) { l1,l2 -> l1 + l2 }
        .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
0
5
9
14
19
26
```

### flatMap()

There are [hundreds of operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html) in RxJava, but we will only cover one more for now. Throughout the book we will learn more as we go, and the most effective way to learn operators is to seek them out of need.

The `flatMap()` is similar to `map()`, but you map the emission to another set of emissions, via another `Observable`. This is one of the most powerful operators in RxJava and is full of use cases, but for now we will just stick with a simple example.

Say we have some emissions where each one contains some concatenated numbers separated by a slash `/`. We want to break up these numbers into separate emissions (and omit the slashes). You can call `split()` on each `String` and  specify splitting it on the slash `/`, and this will return an array of the separated`String` values. Then  you can turn that array into an `Observable` inside the `flatMap()`.

**Java**

```java
Observable.just("123/52/6345","23421/534","758/2341/74932")
		.flatMap(s -> Observable.from(s.split("/")))
		.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Observable.just("123/52/6345","23421/534","758/2341/74932")
         .flatMap { it.split("/").toObservable() }
         .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
123
52
6345
23421
534
758
2341
74932
```

If you observe this closely, hopefully you will  find the `flatMap()` is pretty straightforward, and it is. You are taking each emission and replacing it with another set of emissions, by providing another `Observable`. There is a lot of very powerful ways to leverage the `flatMap()`, especially when used with infinite and hot Observables which we will cover next.

## Observables and Timing

If you are a somewhat experienced developer, you might be asking how is the `Observable` any different than a [Java 8 Stream](http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/07/31/java8-stream-tutorial-examples/) or [Kotlin Sequences](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.sequences/). Up to this point you are correct, they do not seem much different. But recall that Observables *push*, while Java 8 Streams and Kotlin Sequences *pull*. This enables RxJava to achieve much more and unleashes capabilities that these other functional utilities cannot come close to matching.

But the fundamental benefit of *pushing* is it allows a notion of *emissions over time*.  Our previous examples do not exactly show this, but we will dive into some examples that do.

### Making Button Click Events an Observable

So far we just pushed data out of Observables. But did you know you can push events too? As stated earlier, data and events are basically the same thing in RxJava. Let's take a simple JavaFX `Application` with a single `Button`.

**Java**
```java
public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");

        vBox.getChildren().add(button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press Me")
    }
}
```

**Rendered UI:**

![](http://i.imgur.com/x1B5qzi.png)

We can use RxJavaFX or RxKotlinFX to create an `Observable<ActionEvent>` that pushes an `ActionEvent` emission each time the `Button` is pressed.

**Java**
```java
public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .subscribe(ae -> System.out.println(ae));

        vBox.getChildren().add(button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}

```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        button("Press Me")
	        .actionEvents()
          .subscribe { println(it) }
    }
}
```

If you click the `Button` a couple times your console should look something like this:

**OUTPUT:**
```
javafx.event.ActionEvent[source=Button@751b917f[styleClass=button]'Press Me']
javafx.event.ActionEvent[source=Button@751b917f[styleClass=button]'Press Me']
javafx.event.ActionEvent[source=Button@751b917f[styleClass=button]'Press Me']
```

Wait, did we just treat the `ActionEvent` like any other emission and push it through the `Observable`? Yes we did! As said earlier, this is the powerful part of RxJava. It treats events and data in the same way, and you can use all the operators we used earlier. For example, we can use `scan()` to push how many times the `Button` was pressed, and push that into a `Label`.  Just `map()` each `ActionEvent` to a `1` to drive an increment first.

**Java**
```java
public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");
        Label countLabel = new Label("0");

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .map(ae -> 1)
                .scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
                .subscribe(clickCount -> countLabel.setText(clickCount.toString()));

        vBox.getChildren().add(countLabel);
        vBox.getChildren().add(button);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val countLabel = label("0")

        button("Press Me")
                .actionEvents()
                .map { 1 }
                .scan(0) {x,y -> x + y }
                .subscribe { countLabel.text = it.toString() }
    }
}

```

**RENERED UI:** After I clicked the button 4 times

![](http://i.imgur.com/n7swqnB.png)

So how does all this work? The `Observable<ActionEvent>` we created off this `Button` is emitting `ActionEvent` items over time. The timing of each emission depends completely on when the `Button` is clicked. Every time that `Button` is clicked, it pushes an `ActionEvent` emission through the `Observable`.  There is no notion of completion either as this `Observable` is always alive during the life of the `Button`.

Of course you could use operators that make the subscription finite, like `take()`. If you only take 5 `ActionEvent` emissions from the `Button`, it will stop pushing on emission  `4`. Then it will unsubscribe from the source and call `onCompleted()` down the chain to the `Subscriber`.

**Java**
```java
public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");
        Label countLabel = new Label("0");
        Label doneLabel = new Label("");

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .map(ae -> 1)
                .scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
                .take(5)
                .subscribe(
                        clickCount -> countLabel.setText(clickCount.toString()),
                        e -> e.printStackTrace(),
                        () -> doneLabel.setText("Done!")
                        );

        vBox.getChildren().addAll(countLabel, doneLabel,button);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```
**Kotlin**
```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val countLabel = label("0")
        val doneLabel = label("")

        button("Press Me")
                .actionEvents()
                .map { 1 }
                .scan(0) {x,y -> x + y }
                .take(5)
                .subscribeWith {
                    onNext { countLabel.text = it.toString() }
                    onError { it.printStackTrace() }
                    onCompleted { doneLabel.text = "Done!" }
                }
    }
}

A `Button` emitting `ActionEvent` items every time it is clicked is an example of a hot Observable, as opposed to cold Observables which typically push data. Let's dive into this discussion next.

### Cold vs. Hot Observables

The `Observable<ActionEvent>` we created off a `Button` is an example of a hot Observable. Earlier in this chapter, all of our examples emitting `Integer` and `String` items are cold Observables. So what is the difference?

Remember this source `Observable` that simply pushes five `String` emissions?

**Java**
```java
Observable<String> source =
    Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")
```


What do you think will happen if we `subscribe()` to it twice?  Try it out.

**Java**

```java
Observable<String> source =
        Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon");

source.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1: " + s));
source.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2: " +s));
```

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon")

source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1: $it") }
source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2: $it") }
```

You will find the emissions are *replayed* for each `Subscriber`.

**OUTPUT:**
```
Subscriber 1: Alpha
Subscriber 1: Beta
Subscriber 1: Gamma
Subscriber 1: Delta
Subscriber 1: Epsilon
Subscriber 2: Alpha
Subscriber 2: Beta
Subscriber 2: Gamma
Subscriber 2: Delta
Subscriber 2: Epsilon
```
With a **Cold Observable**, every `Subscriber` independently receives all the emissions regardless of when they `Subscribe`. There is no notion of timing making an impact to which emissions they receive. Cold Observables are often used to "play" data independently to each `Subscriber`. This is like giving every `Subscriber` a music CD to play, and they can independently play all the tracks.

**Hot Observables**, however,  will simultaneously push emissions to all Subscribers at the same time. Logically, an effect of this is Subscribers that come later and have missed previous emissions will not receive them. They will only get emissions going forward from the time they `subscribe()`.  Instead of a music CD, Hot Observables are more like radio stations. They will broadcast a given song (emission) to all listeners (Subscribers) at the same time. If a listener misses a song, they missed it.

While data and events are the same in RxJava, Hot Observables are often used to represent events, and creating an `Observable<ActionEvent>` off a `Button` is a hot `Observable`.

Let's do an experiment to see if tardy Subscribers indeed miss previous emissions. `subscribe()`  immediately to a`Button`'s clicks to create the first `Subscriber`. But have another `Button` that when clicked, will `subscribe()` a second `Subscriber`.

**Java**
```java
public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");
        Button secondSubButton = new Button("Subscribe Subscriber 2");

        Observable<ActionEvent> clicks =
            JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button);

        //Subscriber 1
        clicks.subscribe(ae ->
            System.out.println("Subscriber 1 Received Click!"));

        //Subscribe Subscriber 2 when secondSubButton is clicked
        secondSubButton.setOnAction(event -> {
                System.out.println("Subscriber 2 subscribing!");
                secondSubButton.disableProperty().set(true);
                //Subscriber 2
                clicks.subscribe(ae ->
                    System.out.println("Subscriber 2 Received Click!")
                );
            });

        vBox.getChildren().addAll(button,secondSubButton);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val clicks = button("Press Me").actionEvents()

        //Subscriber 1
        clicks.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 Received Click!") }

        //Subscribe Subscriber 2 when this button is clicked
        button("Subscribe Subscriber 2") {
            setOnAction {
                println("Subscriber 2 subscribing!")
                isDisable = true
                clicks.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 Received Click!") }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**RENDERED UI:**

![](http://i.imgur.com/D0FsDK8.png)

Click the "Press Me" `Button` 3 times, then click the "Subscribe Subscriber 2" `Button`. Finally click "Press Me" 2 more times, and you should get this output in your console.

```
Subscriber 1 Received Click!
Subscriber 1 Received Click!
Subscriber 1 Received Click!
Subscriber 2 subscribing!
Subscriber 1 Received Click!
Subscriber 2 Received Click!
Subscriber 1 Received Click!
Subscriber 2 Received Click!
```

Notice that `Subscriber 1` received those first three clicks, and then we subscribed `Subscriber 2`. But notice that `Subscriber 2` has missed those first three clicks. It will never get them because it subscribed too late to a hot Observable. The only emissions `Subscriber 2` receives are the ones that happen after it subscribes.

After `Subscriber 2` is subscribed, you can see the last two emissions were pushed simultaneously to both `Subscriber 1` and `Subscriber 2`.

Again, Cold Observables will replay emissions to each `Subscriber` independently. Hot Observables play emissions all at once to whomever is subscribed, and it will not replay missed emissions to tardy Subscribers.

##ConnectableObservable

We will learn several ways to create hot Observables in this book for different tasks, but one that is worth mentioning now is the `ConnectableObservable`. Among a few other subtle behaviors it creates, it can turn a cold `Observable` into a hot one by forcing its emissions to become hot. To create one, you can take any `Observable` and call its `publish()` method. You can then set up the Subscribers and then call `connect()` to start firing the emissions.

One reason you may do this is because it might be expensive to replay emissions for each `Subscriber`, especially if it is emitting items from a slow database query or some other intensive operation. Notice too that each emission interleaves and goes to each `Subscriber` simultaneously.


**Java**
```java
ConnectableObservable<String> source =
        Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon").publish();

source.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1: " + s));
source.subscribe(s -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2: " +s));

source.connect();
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val source = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta", "Epsilon").publish()

    source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1: $it") }
    source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2: $it") }

    source.connect()
}
```

**OUTPUT:**
```
Subscriber 1: Alpha
Subscriber 2: Alpha
Subscriber 1: Beta
Subscriber 2: Beta
Subscriber 1: Gamma
Subscriber 2: Gamma
Subscriber 1: Delta
Subscriber 2: Delta
Subscriber 1: Epsilon
Subscriber 2: Epsilon
```

Remember though that the `ConnectableObservable` is a hot `Observable` too, so you got to be careful when pushing data through it. If any `Subscriber` comes in *after* the `connect()` is called, there is a good chance it will miss data that was emitted previously.

##Unsubscribing

There is one last operation we need to cover: unsubscribing. Subscription should happen automatically for finite Observables. But for infinite or long-running Observables, there will be times you want to stop the emissions and cancel the entire operation. This will also free up resources in the `Observable` chain and cause it to clean up any resources it was using.

If you want to disconnect a `Subscriber` from an `Observable`  so it stops receiving emissions, there are a couple ways to do this. The easiest way is to note the `subscribe()` method returns a `Subscription` object (not to be confused with the `Subscriber`). This represents the connection between the `Observable` and the `Subscriber`, and you can call `unsubscribe()` on it at any time to dispose the connections so no more emissions are pushed.

For instance, let's take our incrementing `Button` example from earlier and add another `Button` that will unsubscribe the emissions. We need to save the `Subscription` returned from the `subscribe()` method, and then we can refer to it later to call `unsubscribe()` and stop emissions.

**Java**
```java

public final class MyApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me");
        Button unsubscribeButton = new Button("Unsubscribe");

        Label countLabel = new Label("0");

        Subscription subscription = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .map(ae -> 1)
                .scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
                .subscribe(clickCount -> countLabel.setText(clickCount.toString()));

        unsubscribeButton.setOnAction(e -> subscription.unsubscribe());


        vBox.getChildren().addAll(button,unsubscribeButton,countLabel);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val countLabel = label("0")

        val subscription = button("Press Me")
                .actionEvents()
                .map { 1 }
                .scan(0) {x,y -> x + y }
                .subscribe { countLabel.text = it.toString() }


        button("Unsubscribe").setOnAction {
            subscription.unsubscribe()
        }
    }
}
```

Note that when you press the "Unsubscribe" `Button`, the increments stop because the `Subscriber` was unsubscribed, and it instructed the `Observable` to stop sending emissions. Unsubscription automatically happens with finite Observables once `onCompleted()` is called. But with infinite or long-running Observables, you need to manage their unsubscription if you intend to dispose them at some point.

When you have infinite Observables that need to be disposed, it is *very* critical to call `unsubscribe()` on any Subscriptions when you are done with them. If you do not do this, you will run into memory leak problems and the garbage collector will not be able to free those resources.

When you have a lot of Subscriptions to manage and you want to dispose them all at once, you can use a `CompositeSubscription` which acts as a collection of Subscriptions. You can add any number of Subscriptions to it, and when you want to unsubscribe all of them just call its `unsubscribe()` method.

**java**
```java
Observable<ActionEvent> buttonClicks = ...

CompositeSubscription subscriptions = new CompositeSubscription();

Subscription subscription1 =
    buttonclicks.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Clicked!"));

subscriptions.add(subscription1);

Subscription subscription2 =
    buttonclicks.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Clicked Here Too!"));

subscriptions.add(subscription2);

//work with UI, then dispose when done
subscriptions.unsubscribe();
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val buttonClicks: Observable<ActionEvent> = ...
val subscriptions = CompositeSubscription()

buttonclicks.subscribe { println("Clicked!") }
    .addto(subscriptions)

buttonclicks.subscribe { println("Clicked Here Too!") }
    .addto(subscriptions)

//work with UI, then dispose when done
subscriptions.unsubscribe()
```

### Using doOnXXX() Operators

It might be helpful to create a few "side effects" in the middle of an `Observable` chain. In other words, we want to put Subscribers in the middle of the chain at certain points. For instance, it might be helpful to change a "Submit" Button's text to "WORKING" when a request is being processed, as well as disable it so no more requests can be sent until the current one completes.

RxJava has `doOnXXX()` operators that allow you to "peek" into an `Observable` at that point in the chain. For instance, you can use `doOnNext()` and pass a lambda to do something with each emission, like print it. `doOnCompleted()` will fire a specified action when that point of the chain received a completion notification, and `doOnError()` will do the same for an error event. Here is a complete list of these `doOnXXX()` operators in RxJava.

|Operator|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|
|doOnNext()|doOnNext(i -> System.out.println(i))|Performs an action for each emission|
|doOnCompleted()|doOnCompleted(() -> System.out.println("Done!"))|Performs an action on completion|
|doOnError()|doOnError(e -> e.printStackTrace())|Performs an action on an error|
|doOnSubscribe()|doOnSubscribe(() -> System.out.println("Subbing!"))|Performs an action on subscription|
|doOnUnsubscribe()|doOnUnsubscribe(() -> System.out.println("Unsubbing!"))|Performs an action on unsubscription|
|doOnTerminate()|doOnTerminated(() -> System.out.println("I'm done or had an error"))|Performs an action for completion or an error|

#Summary

In this chapter we covered some RxJava fundamentals. The `Observable` treats data and events in the same way, and this is a powerful idea that applies really well with JavaFX. Cold Observables replay emissions to each `Subscriber` independently. Hot Observables will broadcast emissions live to all Subscribers simultaneously, and not replay missed emissions to tardy Subscribers.

This book will continue to cover RxJava and apply it in a JavaFX context. There are hundreds of operators and unfortunately we will not be able to cover them all, but we will focus on the ones that are especially helpful for building JavaFX applications. But if you want to learn more about RxJava itself outside of the JavaFX domain, check out [Learning Reactive Programming with Java 8](https://amzn.com/1785288725) (Nickolay Tsvetinov).

In the next chapter, we are going to dive a little deeper into JavaFX events, and turn `Node` and `ObservableValue` events into Observables.
