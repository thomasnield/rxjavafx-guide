# 2. RxJava Fundamentals

RxJava has two core types: the `Observable` and the `Subscriber`. In the simplest definition, an **Observable** *pushes* things. For a given `Observable<T>`, it will push items of type `T` through a series of operators that form other Observables, and finally the **Subscriber** is what consumes the items at the end of the chain.

Each pushed `T` item is known as an **emission**. Usually there is a finite number of emissions, but sometimes there can be an infinite number of emissions. An emission can represent either data or an event (or both!). This is where the power of reactive programming differentiates itself from Java 8 Streams and Kotlin Sequences. It has a notion of *emissions over time*, and we will explore these ideas in this chapter. 

If you have decent experience with RxJava already, you are welcome to skip this chapter. In later chapters you may encounter RxJAva concepts that are already familiar, but be sure to not skip these as these concepts are introduced from a JavaFX perspective. 

## The `Observable` and `Subscriber`

As stated earlier, an **Observable** pushes things. It pushes things of type `T` through a series of operators forming other `Observables`.  Each pushed item is known as an **emission**. Those emissions are pushed all the way to a `Subscriber` where they are finally consumed. 

You will need to create a **source Observable** where emissions originate from, and there are many factories to do this. To create a source `Observable` that pushes items 1 through 5, declare the following: 

**Java**

```java 
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
```

This source `Observable<Integer>` is saved to a variable named `source`. However, it has not pushed anything yet. In order to start pushing emissions, you need to create a `Subscriber`. The quickest way to do this is call `subscribe()` and pass a lambda specifying what to do with each emission. 

**Java**

```java 
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i));
```
**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)
source.subscribe { println(it) }
```

A **lambda** is a special type of argument specifying an instruction. The lambda above will take each emission and print it, and this is turned into a `Subscriber`. 

>Java 8 and Kotlin have their own ways of expressing lambdas. If you need to learn more about Java 8 lambdas, I would recommend reading at least the first two chapters of [*Java 8 Lambdas*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do) by Richard Warburton before proceeding. You can read the [Kotlin Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html) to learn about lambdas in Kotlin. Lambdas are a very critical syntax feature and you should be familiar with it before moving further. 

Go ahead and run the code above in a test or `main()` method, and you should get the following:

**OUTPUT:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

You can specify up to three lambda arguments on the `subscribe()` method to not only handle each emission, but also to handle the event of an error as well as specify an action when emissions are complete.

**Java**
```java
source.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
                e -> e.printStackTrace(),
                () -> System.out.println("Done!")
        );
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

source.subscribeWith {
    onNext { println(it) }
    onError { it.printStackTrace() }
    onCompleted { println("Done!") }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
Done!
```

Let's briefly break down the `Subscriber` to understand it better. The lambdas are just a shortcut to allow the `subscribe()` method to quickly create a `Subscriber` for you. You can create your own `Subscriber` object explicitly by extending and implementing its three abstract methods: `onNext()`, `onError()`, and `onCompleted()`.  You can then pass this `Subscriber` to the `subscribe()` method directly.

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5);

Subscriber<Integer> subscriber = new Subscriber<Integer>() {
    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
        System.out.println("Done!");
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer integer) {
        System.out.println(integer);
    }
};

source.subscribe(subscriber);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

val subscriber = object: Subscriber<Int>() {
    override fun onCompleted() = println("Done!")

    override fun onNext(t: Int) = println(t)

    override fun onError(e: Throwable) = e.printStackTrace()
}

source.subscribe(subscriber)
```


The `Subscriber`  actually implements the `Observer` interface which defines these three methods. The `onNext()` is what is called to pass an emission. The `onError()` is called when there is an error, and `onCompleted()` is called when there are no more emissions. Logically with infinite Observables, the `onCompleted()` is never called. 

These three methods on the `Observer` are very critical for understanding RxJava, and we will revisit them continuously in this chapter. Although it is helpful for understanding the `Subscriber`, creating your own `Subscriber` objects can be pretty verbose, so it is helpful to use lambdas instead for conciseness. 

Going back to the source `Observable`, there are other factories to create them. Above we emitted the integers 1 through 5. Since these are consecutive, we can use `Observable.range()` to accomplish the same thing. It will emit the numbers 1 through 5 based on their range.

**Java**
```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
```

You can also turn any `Collection` into an `Observable` quickly using `Observable.from()`. 

**Java**
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.from(list);
```

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val list = listOf(1,2,3,4,5)
val source = Observable.from(list)
```
