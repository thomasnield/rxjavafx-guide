# 10. Decoupling Reactive Streams

In this book, we kept our examples fairly coupled and did not bring any UI code separation patterns. This was to keep the focus on Rx topics and not distract away from them. But in this chapter, we will introduce how you can separate Observables and Subscribers cleanly so they are not coupled with each other, even if they are in different parts of the UI. This aids goals to create effective code separation patterns and increase maintainability of complex applications.

RxJavaFX has an important type called the `CompositeObservable` which assists in separating UI code from controllers, models, or whatever entities you prefer in your paradigm. You can also use a [Subject](http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html\), which is both an `Observable` and an `Observer`, to accomplish this. We did not cover Subjects in this book since they are a different Rx animal beyond the scope of this book. The `CompositeObservable` is backed by a `Subject` and streamlines its use for our purposes. It operates much like the  [EventBus found in Google Guava]\(https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained), but in a more Rx-friendly way.

## Using the CompositeObservable

A `CompositeObservable` acts as a proxy between one or more source Observables and one or more Subscribers. You can declare it by calling its constructor with the specified type it will receive/emit.

**Java**

```java
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import rx.javafx.sources.CompositeObservable;
import rx.observables.JavaFxObservable;

public class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    private final CompositeObservable<String> textInputs = new CompositeObservable<>();

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        TextField textField = new TextField();
        Label label = new Label();

        //pass emissions to CompositeObservable
        textInputs.add(JavaFxObservable.valuesOf(textField.textProperty()));

        //receive emissions from CompositeObservable
        textInputs.toObservable()
                .map(s -> new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString())
                .subscribe(label::setText);

        VBox vBox = new VBox(textField, label);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import rx.javafx.kt.addTo
import rx.javafx.kt.toObservable
import rx.javafx.sources.CompositeObservable
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    val textInputs = CompositeObservable<String>()

    override val root = vbox {
        textfield {
            textProperty().toObservable()
                    .addTo(textInputs)
        }

        label {
            textInputs.toObservable()
                    .map(String::reversed)
                    .subscribe { text = it }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 10.1** - A CompositeObservable separates the `TextField` and `Label` and serves as the proxy between them as a source and Subscriber respectively.

The `CompositeObservable` is a proxy between the source Observables and the Subscribers, and it can add sources at any time using the `add()` and `addAll()` methods. Its `toObservable()` method will produce an `Observable` consolidating all the sources into a single `Observable`. The `add()` and `addAll()` methods will yield a `Subscription` and `CompositeSubscription` respectively, and you can use these to `unsubscrbe()` the `CompositeObservable` from the sources at any time.

**Java**

```
Subscription subscription = textInputs.toObservable()
        .map(s -> new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString())
        .subscribe(label::setText);

//do stuff, then dispose
subscription.unsubscribe()
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val subscription = textInputs.toObservable()
        .map(String::reversed)
        .subscribe { text = it }

//do stuff, then dispose
subscription.unsubscribe()
```

### Using CompositeObservable in a Model

Typically, you will hold the `CompositeObservable` in a separate model class of some sort to support your JavaFX applications, and relay emissions from one component to another. This is helpful to not only broadcast universal events throughout your application, but also provide several sources to drive a single event.

**Java**

```java
import javafx.event.ActionEvent;
import rx.javafx.sources.CompositeObservable;

public class MyEventModel {

    private MyEventModel() {}

    private static final MyEventModel instance = new MyEventModel();

    public static MyEventModel getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }

    private final CompositeObservable<ActionEvent> refreshRequests = new CompositeObservable<>();

    public CompositeObservable<ActionEvent> getRefreshRequests() {
        return refreshRequests;
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import javafx.event.ActionEvent
import rx.javafx.sources.CompositeObservable

object MyEventModel {
    val refreshRequests = CompositeObservable<ActionEvent>()
}
```

In this `MyEventModel` we have a `CompositeObservable<ActionEvent>` that handles `refreshRequests`, Let's say we wanted three events to drive a refresh: a `Button`, a `MenuItem`, and a key combination "CTRL + R" on a `TableView`.

If you declare these Observables in three separate places throughtout your UI code, you can add each of them to this `CompositeObservable`.

**Java**

```java
//make refresh Button
Button button = new Button("Refresh");
Observable<ActionEvent> buttonClicks = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button);
MyEventModel.getInstance().getRefreshRequests().add(buttonClicks);


//make refresh MenuItem
MenuItem menuItem = new MenuItem("Refresh");
Observable<ActionEvent> menuItemClicks = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(menuItem);
MyEventModel.getInstance().getRefreshRequests().add(menuItemClicks);


//CTRL + R hotkeys on a TableView
TableView<MyType> tableView = new TableView<>();

Observable<ActionEvent> hotKeyPresses =
    JavaFxObservable.eventsOf(tableView, KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED)
        .filter(ke -> ke.isControlDown() && ke.getCode().equals(KeyCode.R))
        .map(ke -> new ActionEvent());

MyEventModel.getInstance().getRefreshRequests().add(hotKeyPresses);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
//make refresh button
val button = Button("Refresh")
button.actionEvents().addTo(MyEventModel.refreshRequests)

//make refresh MenuItem
val menuItem = MenuItem("Refresh")
menuItem.actionEvents().addTo(MyEventModel.refreshRequests)

//CTRL + R hotkeys on a TableView
val tableView = TableView<MyType>();
tableView.events(KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED)
    .filter { it.isControlDown && it.code == KeyCode.R }
    .map { ActionEvent() }
    .addTo(MyEventModel.refreshRequests)
```

These three event sources are now consolidated into one `CompositeObservable`. You can then have one or more Subscribers `subscribe()` to this `CompositeObservable`, and they will respond to any of these three sources requesting a refresh.

**Java**

```java
//subscribe to refresh events
MyEventModel.getInstance()
    .getRefreshRequests().toObservable()
    .subscribe(ae -> refresh());
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
MyEventModel.refreshRequests.toObservable()
    .subscribe { refresh() }
```

You can set up as many models as you like with as many CompositeObservables as you like to pass different data and events back-and-forth throughout your application.

## Modifying CompositeObservable Behavior

The `CompositeObservable` actually houses a `Subject` as well as an `Observable` built off that `Subject`, and it will return that same `Observable` every time `toObservable()` is called.

When you construct a `CompositeObservable` you can actually pass a lambda specifying what operators to add to that backing `Observable`. This enables you to perform operations like `replay(1).autoConnect()` so new subscribers will always recieve the last emitted value. This can be helpful especially in JavaFX applications, where the current value in a control is always broadcasted even after the event it changed.

**Java**

```java
private final CompositeObservable<Integer> selectedId =
        new CompositeObservable<>(obs -> obs.replay(1).autoConnect());
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val selectedId = CompositeObservable<Int> { it.replay(1).autoConnect() }
```

The only catch is for a given `CompositeObservable<T>` accepting `Observable<T>` inputs, the modifications must also yield an `Observable<T>`.

## Summary

In this chapter we covered how to separate reactive streams between UI components with the `CompositeObservable`, which serves as a proxy between Observable sources and subscribers. You can put `CompositeObservable` instances in a backing class to serve as an Rx-flavored event bus to relay data and events. Use the `CompositeObservable` to consolidate mutliple event sources that drive the same action, or to cleanly separate your Observable sources and subscribers.

# Closing

You have reached the end of this book. Congrats! Keep researching RxJava and learn what it can do inside and outside of JavaFX. You will find it is used on Android via the RxAndroid library, as well as on backend development with RxNetty and other frameworks. I encourage you to keep learning the various operators and check out books and online resources to grow your proficiency.

Since I started writing this book, Packt Publishing has reached out to me and asked if I could write _Learning RxJava 2.0_. I have already started this project, and I hope it helps people much like this eBook has. Please follow me on Twitter @thomasnield9727 for updates on all things Rx.
