# Dialogs and Multicasting

In this chapter we will cover using Dialogs as well as multicasting. Dialogs are helpful for getting user inputs, and they have even more relevance in an Rx context. Multicasting is a way to force Observables to be hot, and we will learn why it is critical to do this when multiple Subscribers to a UI event `Observable` are present.

## Dialogs

[JavaFX Dialogs](http://code.makery.ch/blog/javafx-8-dialogs/) are popups to quickly show a message to the user or solicit an input. They can be helpful in reactive applications, so they also have a factory to turn their response into an `Observable`.

You can pass an `Alert` or `Dialog` to the `fromDialog()` factory, and it will return an `Observable` that emits the response as a single emission. Then it will call `onCompleted()`.

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
    new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to do this?")
).subscribe(response -> System.out.println("You pressed " + response.getText()));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to do this?")
   .toObservable()
   .subscribe { println("You pressed " + response.text) }
```

Dialogs can become more useful in a `flatMap()` to intercept and manipulate emissions. If you `flatMap()` a `Button`'s ActionEvents to a `Dialog` response, you can use `filter()` on the response to conditionally allow an emission to go forward or be suppressed.

For example, say you have a "Run Process" `Button` that will kick of a simple process  emitting the integers 1 through 10, and then collects them into a `List`. Pretend this process was something more intensive, and you want the user to confirm on pressing the `Button` if they want to run it. You can use a `Dialog` to intercept `ActionEvent` emissions in a `flatMap()`, map to the `Dialog`'s response, and allow only emissions that are `ButtonType.OK`. Then you can `flatMap()` that emission to kick off the process \(Figure 6.3\).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Button runButton = new Button("Run Process");

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(runButton)
                .flatMap(ae ->
                        JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to run the process?"))
                            .filter(response -> response.equals(ButtonType.OK))
                ).flatMap(response -> Observable.range(1,10).toList())
                .subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Processed integer list: " + i));

        VBox root = new VBox();
        root.getChildren().add(runButton);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {
        button("Run Process").actionEvents()
            .flatMap {
                Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to run the process?")
                    .toObservable()
                    .filter { it == ButtonType.OK }
            }.flatMap { Observable.range(1,10).toList() }
            .subscribe { println("Processed integer list: $it") }
    }
}
```

That `flatMap()` to an `Alert` dialog will emit a `ButtonData.OK` or `ButtonData.CANCEL` response depending on what the user chooses. Filtering for only `ButtonData.OK` emissions, only those emissions will result in a kickoff of the `.flatMap { Observable.range(1,10).toList() }` process. Otherwise it will be empty and no `List<Integer>` will be emitted at all. This shows we can use a `Dialog` or `Alert` inputs to intercept and manipulate emissions in an `Observable` chain.

Here is another example. Let's say clicking a `Button` will emit an `ActionEvent`. You will then have integers 0 through 10 emitted inside a `flatMap()` for each `ActionEvent`, and you want the user to decide which integers should proceed to the `Subscriber`. Using some creative flatmapping, this is not terribly hard. You can use an `Alert` or `Dialog` for each integer emission to control which ones will go forward \(Figure 6.4\).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Button runButton = new Button("Run Process");

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(runButton)
                .flatMap(ae ->
                        Observable.range(1,10)
                            .flatMap(i ->
                                    JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                                            new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,
                                                    "Are you sure you want to process integer " + i + "?",
                                                    ButtonType.NO, ButtonType.YES)
                                            ).filter(response -> response.equals(ButtonType.YES))
                                            .map(response -> i)
                            )

                ).subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Processed integer: " + i));

        VBox root = new VBox();
        root.getChildren().add(runButton);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {
        button("Run Process").actionEvents()
                .flatMap {
                    Observable.range(1, 10).flatMap { i ->
                        Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,
                                "Do you want to process integer $i?",
                                ButtonType.NO, ButtonType.YES
                        ).toObservable()
                        .filter { it == ButtonType.YES }
                        .map { response -> i }
                    }
                }.subscribe { println("Processed integer: $it") }
    }
}
```

The `.map(response -> i)` is a simple trick you can do to take a response after it has been filtered, and map it back to the integer. If you say "YES" to 1, 3, 6 and "NO" to everything else, you should get the output above. 2,4,5,7,9, and 10 never made it to the `Subscriber` because "NO" was selected and filterd out.

That is how you can reactively leverage Dialogs and Alerts, and any control that implements `Dialog` to return a single result can be reactively emitted in this way.

### Multicasting

For the sake of keeping the previous chapters accessible, I might have mislead you when I said UI events are hot Observables. The truth is they are a gray area between a hot and cold `Observable` \(or should I say "warm"?\). Remember, a "hot" `Observable` will emit to all Subscribers at once, while a "cold" `Observable` will replay emissions to each `Subscriber`. This is a pragmatic way to separate the two, but UI event factories in RxJavaFX \(as well as RxAndroid\) awkwardly operate as both hot and cold unless you **multicast**, or force an emission to hotly be emitted to all Subscribers.

To understand this subtle impact, here is a trick question. Say you have an `Observable` driven off a `Dialog` or `Alert`, and it has two Subscribers. Do you think the response is going to go to both Subscribers?

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Observable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));


        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

Try running it and you will see the `Alert` popup twice, once for each `Subscriber`. This is almost like it's a cold `Observable` and it is "replaying" the `Dialog` procedure for each `Subscriber`. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what is happening. Both Subscribers are receiving their own, independent streams. You can actually say `OK` on one `Subscriber` and `CANCEL` to the other. The two Subscribers are, in fact, not receiving the same emission as you would expect in a hot `Observable`.

This behavior is not a problem when you have one `Subscriber`. But when you have multiple Subscribers, you will start to realize this is not a 100% hot `Observable`. It is "hot" in that previous emissions are missed by tardy Subscribers, but it is not "hot" in that a single set of emissions are going to all Subscribers. To force the latter to happen, you can multicast, and that will force this `Observable` to be 100% hot.

One way to multicast is to use the  `ConnectableObservable` we used in Chapter 2. We can `publish()` the `Observable` to get a `ConnectableObservable`, set up up the `Subscribers`, _then_ call `connect()` to start firing the same emissions to all Subscribers.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        ConnectableObservable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK))
         .publish(); //returns ConnectableObservable

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));

        response.connect();

        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }
            .publish() //returns ConnectableObservable

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        response.connect()

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

When you run this program, you will now see the `Alert` only pop up once, and the single response will go to both Subscribers simultaneously. Every operator _before_ the `publish()` will be a single stream of emissions. But take note that everything _after_ the `publish()` is subject to be on separate streams from that point.

If you want this `ConnectableObservable` to automatically `connect()` for you when the first `Subscriber` is subscribed, you can call `refCount()` to turn it back into an `Observable`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Observable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK))
         .publish()
         .refCount();

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));

        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }
            .publish()
            .refCount()

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

`refCount()` is a convenient way to turn a `ConnectableObservable` back into an automatic `Observable`. It is helpful to force emissions to be hot without manually calling `connect()`. Just be aware it will start emitting on the first subscription, and any following subscriptions may miss the first emissions as they are subscribed _after_ the firing starts. But for UI events waiting for a user input, chances are all subscriptions will `connect()` in time before the user inputs anything, so `refCount()` is usually acceptable for UI events. But if your Observable is going to fire emissions the moment it is subscribed, you may just want to manually set up a `ConnectableObservable`, subscribe the Subscribers, and call `connect()` yourself.

So when should you multicast with a `ConnectableObservable` \(or its `refCount()`\)? The answer is when you have multiple Subscribers to a single UI event `Observable`. When you broadcast something as simple as a `Button`'s ActionEvents, it is more efficient to multicast it so it does not create a `Listener` for each `Subscriber`, but rather consolidates to one `Listener`.

Here is proof. Let's create two Subscribers to a `Button`'s actionEvents. Put a `doOnSubscribe()` operator that will print a notification that the `Observable` is being subscribed at that point in the chain. If you do it without the `publish().refCount()`, you will see the `doOnSubscribe()` will print the message twice, indicating that there are two subscription streams going on \(and hence two Listeners\). But if you include the `publish().refCount()`, you will see it print only once, indicating that both Subscribers are listening to the same stream.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        Button button = new Button("Press Me");

        Observable<ActionEvent> clickEvents = JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .doOnSubscribe(() -> System.out.println("Subscribing!"))
                .publish().refCount();

        clickEvents.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 fired!"));
        clickEvents.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 fired!"));

        root.getChildren().add(button);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

       val clickEvents = button("Press Me")
               .actionEvents()
               .doOnSubscribe { println("Subscribing!") }
               .publish().refCount()

        clickEvents.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 fired!") }
        clickEvents.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 fired!") }
    }
}
```

Again, use multicasting for UI event Observables when there is more than one Subscriber. Even though most of the time this makes no functional difference, it is more efficient. It also will prevent subtle misbehaviors like we saw in cases like the `Dialog`, where we want to force a single emission stream to go to all Subscribers rather than each Subscriber getting its own emissions in a cold-like manner. If you have only one `Subscriber`, the additional overhead of `ConnectableObservable` is not necessary.

### Replaying Observables

Another kind of `ConnectableObservable` is the one returned by the `replay()` operator. This will hold on to the last _x_ number of emissions and "replay" them to each new `Subscriber`.

For instance, an `Observable` can emit the numbers 1 through 5. If I call `replay(1)` on it, it will return a `ConnectableObservable` that will emit the last emission "5" to later Subscribers. However if I am going to multicast this, I may want to use `autoConnect()` instead of `refCount()`. Here is why: the `refCount()` will "shut down" when it has no more Subscribers \(including Subscribers that call `onCompleted()`\). This will reset everything and clear the "5" from its cache. If another Subscriber comes in, it will be treated as the first Subscriber and receive all 5 emissions rather than just the "5". The `autoConnect()`, however, will always stay alive whether or not it has Subscribers, and persist the cached value of "5" indefinitely until a new value replaces it.

**Java**

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .replay(1).autoConnect();

range.subcribe(i -> System.out.prinln(i)); //receives 1,2,3,4,5
Thread.sleep(3000); //sleep 3 seconds, try-catch this
range.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i)); //receives 5
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .replay(1).autoConnect()

source.subscribe { println(it) } //receives 1,2,3,4,5
Thread.sleep(3000) //sleep 3 seconds, try-catch this
source.subscribe { println(it) } //receives 5
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
5
```

The `replay()` operator can be helpful to replay the last emitted value for a UI input \(e.g a `ComboBox`\) so new Subscribers immediately get that value rather than missing it. There are other argument overloads for `replay()` to replay emissions for other scopes, like time windows. But simply holding on to the last emission is a common helpful pattern for reactive UI's.

> You can also use the `cache()` operator to horde and replay _ALL_ emissions, but keep in mind this can increase memory usage and cause data to go stale.

### Summary

If you got this far, congrats! We have covered a lot. We ran through reactive usage of Dialogs, which you can use to intercept emissions and get a user input for each one, as well as multicasting. The topic of multicasting is a critical one to understand because UI Observables do not always act hot when multiple Subscribers are subscribed. Creating a `ConnectableObservable` is an effective way to force an `Observable` to become hot and ensure each emission goes to all Subscribers at once.

Make sure you are somewhat comfortable with the material we covered so far, because next we are going to cover concurrency. This is the topic that everything leads up to, as RxJava revolutionizes how we multithread safely and robustly.
