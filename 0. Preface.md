# Preface

Over the past year or so, I have discovered so much can be achieved leveraging reactive programming in JavaFX applications. To this day I still discover amazing patterns that RxJava allows in JavaFX applications. RxJavaFX is merely a layer between these two technologies to make them talk to each other, and unleash the capabilities of Rx in desktop applications.

I guess the best way to introduce RxJavaFX is to share how it came about.  In 2014, I had already developed some Swing applications that were used internally at my company. These applications were quite involved with lots of interactivity, data processing, and complex user inputs. Like most UI applications, these were a beat-down to build. Naturally, I was drawn to JavaFX and was particularly intrigued by the `ObservableValue`, `ObservableList`, and other data structures that notified the UI automatically of their changes. No more `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`!   Although I briefly considered HTML5 as my next platform, JavaFX showed more promise in the environment I worked in. 

Keeping things synchronized between different components in a UI is difficult, so I liked JavaFX's idea of Bindings and ObservableValues. I became fascinated by this idea of events triggering other events, and a value notifying another value of its change. I started to believe there should be a way to express this functionally much like Java 8 Streams, and I had a vague idea what I was looking for. But as I studied JavaFX deeper, I became frustrated.  JavaFX does have `Binding` functionality that can synchronize properties and events of different controls, but the ability to express transformations was very limited. 

One morning, someone in an online community suggested I check out [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX), a reactive JavaFX library built by Tomas Mikula. This opened up my world and I discovered reactive programming for the first time. I played with the `EventStream` and was composing events and data together. It was awesome! I knew at that moment, reactive programming was the solution I was looking for. 

I originally set out to use reactive programming as a way to handle UI events, and ReactFX was perfect for this. But I began to suspect I was missing the bigger picture. I researched reactive programming further and discovered [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), a reactive API with a rich ecosystem of libraries built around it, including [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc). This library allows concise reactive SQL querying against a pool of JDBC connections using RxJava.  Sold! As someone who makes data-driven applications, this was a killer feature I now *needed*. It soon became clear in the reactive programming, events are data, and data are events! 

But how do I plug RxJava into ReactFX?

To create a fully effective reactive solution, I needed RxJava to talk to ReactFX. I tried this task and it was wrought with problems. Technically it was difficult turning a ReactFX `EventStream` into an RxJava `Observable` and vice versa. I also realized ReactFX encourages doing everything on the JavaFX thread, but I wanted to switch between threads easily allowing concurrency. There is nothing wrong with ReactFX. It is awesome library that simply had a different purpose and goal. 

During my struggle I stumbled on the [RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX) project. It was a small library that converted `Node` and `ObservableValue` events into RxJava Observables. It also contained a `Scheduler` for the JavaFX thread. I knew immediately this was the alternative to ReactFX I needed, but some folks at Netflix were having some build issues with it. Ben Christensen was eager to give it away to someone who knew JavaFX, as nobody at Netflix used JavaFX. After a period of no activity, I reluctantly volunteered to take ownership of it. I doubted my ability to solve the build issue, but after hours of Googling, trawling GitHub projects with similar issues, and making a few tweaks, it finally worked! I was able to get it released on Maven Central and RxJavaFX was now live. 

When I took ownership of the RxJavaFX library, I doubted it would progress beyond turning JavaFX `Node` events and `ObservableValue` changes into RxJava Observables. But I quickly learned there was much more to be done. JavaFX was built with event hooks everywhere, including collections like `ObservableList`. This provided all the tools needed to make a fully reactive API for JavaFX, and there was a lot of power yet to be unleashed. With random epiphanies as well as some guidance from the community, RxJavaFX has become a robust solution to integrate JavaFX into the RxJava ecosystem.

So let's get started!
