# 5\. Combining Observables

So far in this book, we have merely set the stage to make Rx useful. We learned how to emit JavaFX Events, ObservableValues, and ObservableCollections through RxJava Observables. But there is only so much you can do when a reactive stream is built off one source. When you have emissions from multiple Observables being joined together in some form, this is truly where the "rubber meets the road".

There are several ways to combine emissions from multiple Observables, and we will cover many of these combine operators. What makes these operators especially powerful is they are not only threadsafe, but also non-blocking. They can merge concurrent sources from different threads, but we will see this in action later in Chapter 7.

## Concatenation

One of the simplest ways to combine Observables is to use the `concat()` operators. You can specify two or more Observables emitting the same type `T` and it will fire emissions from each one sequentially.

**Java**

```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon");

Observable.concat(source1,source2)
    .map(String::length)
    .toList()
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma")
        val source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon")

Observable.concat(source1,source2)
        .map { it.length }
        .toList()
        .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
[5, 4, 5, 5, 7]
```

It is very critical to note that `onCompleted()` must be called on each `Observable` so it moves on to the next one. If you have an `Observable` in a concatenated operation, it will hold up the line by infinitely emitting items, forever keeping any Observables after it from getting fired.

Concatentation is also available as an operator and not just a factory, and it should yield the same output.

**Java**

```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon");

source1.concatWith(source2)
    .map(String::length)
    .toList()
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma")
val source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon")

source1.concatWith(source2)
    .map { it.length }
    .toList()
    .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
[5, 4, 5, 5, 7]
```

If you want to do a concenation but put another `Observable` in front rather than after, you can use `startWith()` instead.

**Java**

```java
Observable<String> source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma");
Observable<String> source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon");

source1.startWith(source2)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val source1 = Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma")
val source2 = Observable.just("Delta","Epsilon")

source1.startWith(source2)
        .subscribe { println(it) }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Delta
Epsilon
Alpha
Beta
Gamma
```

Again, this operator is likely not one you would use with infinite Observables. You are more likely to use this for data-driven Observables rather than UI events. Technically, you can specify an infinite `Observable` to be the last `Observable` to concatenate. That way it is not holding up any other Observables.

When you want to simultaneously combine all emissions from all Observables, you might want to consider using `merge()`, which is covered next.

## Merging

Merging is almost like concatenation but with one important difference: it will combine all Observables of a given emission type `T` *simultaneously*. This means all emissions from all Observables are merged together at once into a single stream without any regard for order or completion.

This is pretty helpful to merge multiple UI event sources since they are infinite. For instance, you can consolidate the `ActionEvent` emissions of two buttons into a single `Observable<ActionEvent>` using `Observable.merge()`. (Figure 5.1).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox root = new VBox();

        Button firstButton = new Button("Press Me");
        Button secondButton = new Button("Press Me Too");

        Observable.merge(
                JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(firstButton),
                JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(secondButton)
        ).subscribe(i -> System.out.println("You pressed one of the buttons!"));

        root.getChildren().addAll(firstButton,secondButton);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        val buttonUp = button("Press Me")
        val buttonDown = button("Press Me Too")

        Observable.merge(
                buttonUp.actionEvents(),
                buttonDown.actionEvents()
        )
        .subscribe {
            System.out.println("You pressed one of the buttons!")
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 5.1**

When you press either `Button`, it will consolidate the emissions into a single `Observable<ActionEvent>` which goes to a single `Subscriber`. But let's make this more interesting. Change these two Buttons so they are labeled "UP" and "DOWN", and map their `ActionEvent` to either a `1` or `-1` respectively. Using a `scan()` we can create a rolling sum of these emissions and push the incrementing/decrementing number to a `Label` (Figure 5.2).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox root = new VBox();

        Label label = new Label("0");

        Button buttonUp = new Button("UP");
        Button buttonDown = new Button("DOWN");

        Observable.merge(
                JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(buttonUp).map(ae -> 1),
                JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(buttonDown).map(ae -> -1)
        ).scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
         .subscribe(i -> label.setText(i.toString()));

        root.getChildren().addAll(label,buttonUp,buttonDown);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**s

```kotlin

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {
    override val root = vbox {
        val label = label("0")
        val buttonUp = button("UP")
        val buttonDown = button("DOWN")

        Observable.merge(
                buttonUp.actionEvents().map { 1 },
                buttonDown.actionEvents().map { -1 }
        ).scan(0) { x,y -> x + y }
        .subscribe {
            label.text = it.toString()
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 5.2**

![](http://i.imgur.com/cSWclq8.png)

When you press the "UP" `Button`, it will increment the integer in the `Label`. When you press the "DOWN" `Button`, it will decrement it. This was accomplished by merging the two resulting Observables returned from the `map()` operator. The `1` or `-1` is then pushed to the `scan()` operation where it is emitted as a rolling total.

Like concatenation, there is also an operator version you can use instead of the factory to merge an `Observable<T>` with another `Observable<T>`

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(buttonUp).map(ae -> 1)
    .mergeWith(
        JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(buttonDown).map(ae -> -1)
    ).scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
    .subscribe(i -> label.setText(i.toString()));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
 buttonUp.actionEvents().map { 1 }
    .mergeWith(
        buttonDown.actionEvents().map { -1 }
    ).scan(0) { x,y -> x + y }
    .subscribe {
        label.text = it.toString()
    }
```

With both `concat()` and `merge()`, you can combine as many Observables as you want. But thes two operators work with Observables emitting the same type `T`. There are ways to combine emissions of different types which we will see next.

## Zip

You can combine multiple Observables, even if they are different types, by "zipping" their emissions together. Think of a zipper on a jacket and how the teeth pair up. From a reactive perspective, this means taking one emission from the first `Observable`, and one from a second `Observable`, and combining both emisssions together in some way.

Take these two Observables, one emitting Strings and the other emitting Integers. For each `String` that is emitted, you can pair it with an emitted `Integer` and concatenate them together.

**Java**

```java
Observable<String> letters = Observable.just("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F");
Observable<Integer> numbers = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

Observable.zip(letters, numbers, (l, n) -> l + "-" + n)
        .subscribe(System.out::println,
                Throwable::printStackTrace,
                () -> System.out.println("Done!")
        );
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val letters = Observable.just("A","B","C","D","E","F")
val numbers = Observable.just(1,2,3,4,5)

Observable.zip(letters,numbers) {l,n -> "$l-$n"}
    .subscribeWith {
        onNext { println(it) }
        onError { it.printStackTrace() }
        onCompleted { println("Done!") }
    }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
A-1
B-2
C-3
D-4
E-5
Done!
```

Notice that "A" paired with the "1", and "B" paired with the "2", and so on. Again, you are "zipping" them just like a jacket zipper. But take careful note of something: there are 6 `letters` emissions and 5 `numbers` emissions. What happened to that sixth letter "F" since it had no number to zip with? Well, since the two zipped sources do not have the same number of emissions, it was ignored the moment `onCompleted()` was called by `numbers`. Logically, it will never have anything to pair with so it gave up and proceeded to skip it and call `onCompleted()` down to the `Subscriber`.

There is also an operator equivalent called `zipWith()` you can use. This should yield the exact same output.

**Java**

```java
letters.zipWith(numbers, (l, n) -> l + "-" + n)
        .subscribe(System.out::println,
                Throwable::printStackTrace,
                () -> System.out.println("Done!")
        );
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
letters.zipWith(numbers) {l,n -> "$l-$n"}
    .subscribeWith {
        onNext { println(it) }
        onError { it.printStackTrace() }
        onCompleted { println("Done!") }
    }
```

Zipping can be helpful when you need to sequentially pair things from two sources, but from my experience this rarely works well with UI events. Let's adapt this example to see why.


Suppose you create two `ComboBox` controls holding these letters and numbers respectively. You want to create an `Observable` off each one that emits the selected values. Then you want to zip the values together, concatentate them into a single `String`, and print them in a `Subscriber`. You are really looking to combine two different user inputs together (Figure 5.3).


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        ComboBox<String> letterCombo = new ComboBox<>();
        letterCombo.getItems().setAll("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F");

        ComboBox<Integer> numberCombo = new ComboBox<>();
        numberCombo.getItems().setAll(1,2,3,4,5);

        Observable<String> letterSelections =
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(letterCombo.valueProperty());

        Observable<Integer> numberSelections =
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(numberCombo.valueProperty());

        Observable.zip(letterSelections, numberSelections, (l, n) -> l + "-" + n)
                .subscribe(System.out::println,
                        Throwable::printStackTrace,
                        () -> System.out.println("Done!")
                );

        HBox root = new HBox();
        root.getChildren().setAll(letterCombo,numberCombo);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = hbox {

        val letterSelections = combobox<String> {
            items.setAll("A","B","C","D","E","F")
        }.valueProperty().toObservable()

        val numberSelections = combobox<Int> {
            items.setAll(1,2,3,4,5)
        }.valueProperty().toObservable()

        Observable.zip(letterSelections,numberSelections) {l,n -> "$l-$n"}
            .subscribeWith {
                onNext { println(it) }
                onError { it.printStackTrace() }
                onCompleted { println("Done!") }
            }
    }
}
```

This seems like a good idea, right? When I select a letter, and I select a number, the two are zipped together and sent to the `Subscriber`! But there is something subtle and problematic with zipping for this case. Select multiple letters without selecting any numbers, *then* select multiple numbers. Notice how the letters are backlogged and each one is waiting for a number to be paired with? This is problematic and probably not what you intended. If you select "A", then "B", then "C" followed by "1", then "2", then "3", you are going to get "A-1", "B-2", and "C-3" printed to the console. If you were expecting "C-1", "C-2", and "C-3" or something else, you probably do not want to use zipping.

Here is another way of looking at it. The problem with our zipping example is for every selected "letter", you need to select a "number" to evenly pair with it. If you make several selections to one combo box and neglect to make selections on the other, you are going to have a backlog of emissions waiting to be paired. If you select eight different letters (shown below), and only four numbers, the next number you select is going to pair with the "D". If you select another letter its only going to worsen the backlog and make it more confusing what the next number will pair with.

```
A 1
B 5
A 3
A 6
D
C
A
F
```

If you want to only combine the *latest* values from each `Observable` and ignore previous ones, you might want to use `combineLatest()` which we will cover next.

>ote you can make zip more than two Observables. If you have three Observables, it will zip three emissions together before consolidating them into a single emission.

## Combine Latest

With our zipping example earlier, it might be more expected if we combine values by chasing after the *latest* ones. Using `combineLatest()` instead of `zip()`, we can select a value in either `ComboBox`. Then it will emit with the latest value from the other `ComboBox`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        ComboBox<String> letterCombo = new ComboBox<>();
        letterCombo.getItems().setAll("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F");

        ComboBox<Integer> numberCombo = new ComboBox<>();
        numberCombo.getItems().setAll(1,2,3,4,5);

        Observable<String> letterSelections =
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(letterCombo.valueProperty());

        Observable<Integer> numberSelections =
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(numberCombo.valueProperty());

        Observable.combineLatest(letterSelections, numberSelections, (l, n) -> l + "-" + n)
                .subscribe(System.out::println,
                        Throwable::printStackTrace,
                        () -> System.out.println("Done!")
                );

        HBox root = new HBox();
        root.getChildren().setAll(letterCombo,numberCombo);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = hbox {

        val letterSelections = combobox<String> {
            items.setAll("A","B","C","D","E","F")
        }.valueProperty().toObservable()

        val numberSelections = combobox<Int> {
            items.setAll(1,2,3,4,5)
        }.valueProperty().toObservable()

        Observable.combineLatest(letterSelections,numberSelections) {l,n -> "$l-$n"}
            .subscribeWith {
                onNext { println(it) }
                onError { it.printStackTrace() }
                onCompleted { println("Done!") }
            }
    }
}
```

If you select "A","4", "E", and then "1", you should get this output.

**OUTPUT:**

```
null-null
A-null
A-4
E-4
E-1
```

Note the `null` values are expected because that is what the initial values for the ComboBoxes are. When you select "A" it emits with the latest number value, which is still `null`. Selecting "4" will then emit with the latest letter "A". Then selecting "E" will emit with the latest number "4", and finally selecting "1" will emit with "E".

Simply put, a change in value for either `ComboBox` will result in the latest value for both being pushed forward. For combining UI input events, we often are only concerned with the latest user inputs and do not care about previous ones. Therefore, `combineLatest()` can be really handy.

Another powerful usage of `combineLatest()` is merging two ObservableLists into one, and always keeping it synchronized when additions or removals happen to either.


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        //declare two ObservableLists
        ObservableList<String> startLocations =
                FXCollections.observableArrayList("Dallas","Houston","Chicago","Boston");

        ObservableList<String>  endLocations =
                FXCollections.observableArrayList("San Diego", "Salt Lake City", "Seattle");

        //this ObservableList will hold contents of both
        ObservableList<String> allLocations = FXCollections.observableArrayList();

        //this will pump both ObservableLists into `allLocations`
        Observable.combineLatest(
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(startLocations),
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(endLocations),
                (l1,l2) -> {
                    ArrayList<String> combined = new ArrayList<>();
                    combined.addAll(l1);
                    combined.addAll(l2);
                    return combined;
                }
        ).subscribe(allLocations::setAll);

        //print `allLocations` every time it changes, to prove its working
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(allLocations).subscribe(System.out::println);

        //do modifications to trigger above operations
        startLocations.add("Portland");
        endLocations.add("Dallas");
        endLocations.add("Phoenix");
        startLocations.remove("Boston");

        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = hbox {

        //declare two ObservableLists
        val startLocations =
                FXCollections.observableArrayList("Dallas","Houston","Chicago","Boston")

        val endLocations =
                FXCollections.observableArrayList("San Diego", "Salt Lake City", "Seattle")

        //this ObservableList will hold contents of both
        val allLocations = FXCollections.observableArrayList<String>()

        //this will pump both ObservableLists into `allLocations`
        Observable.combineLatest(startLocations.onChangedObservable(),
                endLocations.onChangedObservable()) {l1,l2 ->
           ArrayList<String>().apply {
               addAll(l1)
               addAll(l2)
           }
        }.subscribe {
            allLocations.setAll(it)
        }

        //print `allLocations` every time it changes, to prove its working
        allLocations.onChangedObservable().subscribe { println(it) }

        //do modifications to trigger above operations
        startLocations.add("Portland")
        endLocations.add("Dallas")
        endLocations.add("Phoenix")
        startLocations.remove("Boston")

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

**OUTPUT:***

```
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Dallas]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Dallas, Phoenix]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Dallas, Phoenix]
```

Whenever either `ObservableList` (`startLocations` or `endLocations`) is modified, it will update the combined `ObservableList` (`allLocations`) so it always reflects the contents of both. This is a powerful way to leverage JavaFX ObservableCollections and combine them to drive the content of other ObservableCollections.

If you want to get extra crazy, you can easily modfiy this operation so that the combined `ObservableList` only contains *distinct* items from both ObservableLists. Simply add a `flatMap()` before the `Subscriber` that intercepts the `ArrayList`, turns it into an `Observable`, distincts it, and collects it back into a `List`. Notice when you run it, the duplicate "Dallas" emission is suppressed.

**Java**

```java
Observable.combineLatest(
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(startLocations),
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(endLocations),
        (l1,l2) -> {
            ArrayList<String> combined = new ArrayList<>();
            combined.addAll(l1);
            combined.addAll(l2);
            return combined;
        }
).flatMap(l -> Observable.from(l).distinct().toList())
.subscribe(allLocations::setAll);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Observable.combineLatest(startLocations.onChangedObservable(),
        endLocations.onChangedObservable()) {l1,l2 ->
   ArrayList<String>().apply {
       addAll(l1)
       addAll(l2)
   }
}.flatMap {
    it.toObservable().distinct().toList()
}.subscribe {
    allLocations.setAll(it)
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Phoenix]
[Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Portland, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Phoenix]
```

While this is a pretty procedural example, using `combineLatest()` with ObservableLists has very powerful applications, especially with data controls. Combining data from two different data controls (like TableViews), you can merge the two data sets into some form of aggregation in a third control. All three data controls will always be synchronized, and you can published the combined `ObservableList` while it is internally driven by two or more ObservableCollections backing it.

A more advanced but elegant way to accomplish either task above is to return an `Observable<Observable<String>>` from the `combineLatest()`, and then flatten it with a `flatMap()` afterwards. This avoids creating an intermediary `ArrayList` and is a bit leaner.

**Java**

```java
Observable.combineLatest(
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(startLocations),
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableList(endLocations),
        (l1,l2) -> Observable.from(l1).concatWith(Observable.from(l2))
).flatMap(obs -> obs.distinct().toList())
.subscribe(allLocations::setAll);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Observable.combineLatest(startLocations.onChangedObservable(),
        endLocations.onChangedObservable()) {l1,l2 ->

        l1.toObservable().concatWith(l2.toObservable())
}.flatMap {
    it.distinct().toList()
}.subscribe {

Do not worry if you find the code above hard to understand right now. It is a creative solution, and you can feel free to move on and study it again later. I am sure you will have that "aha!" moment once you get more comfortable with Rx.

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered combining Observables and which combine operators are helpful to use with UI events vs simply merging data. Hopefully by now, you are excited that you can achieve tasks beyond what the JavaFX API provides. Tasks like synchronizing an `ObservableList` to the contents of two other ObservableLists become almost trival with reactive programming. Soon we will get to the most anticipated feature of RxJava: concurrency with `observabeOn()` and `subscribeOn()`. But first, we will cover a few final topics before we hit that.
