# Introduction

Welcome! I am glad you picked up this guide on applying RxJava to JavaFX. Over the past year or so I have discovered so much can be achieved mixing these two powerful frameworks. 

I have a cheesy testimony to share on how I discovered reactive programming. In 2014, I had already developed some Swing applications that were used internally at my company. These applications were quite involved with lots of interactivity, data processing, and complex user inputs. Like most UI applications, these were a beatdown to build. Therefore I was drawn to JavaFX and was particularly intrigued by the `ObservableValue`, `ObservableList`, and other data structures that notified the UI automatically of their changes. No more `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`!   Although I briefly considered HTML5 as my next platform, JavaFX showed more promise in the environment I worked in. 

But building UI's is a cumbersome and verbose experience, so I liked JavaFX's idea of Bindings and ObservableValues. I became fascinated by this idea of events triggering other events, and a value notifying another value it changed. I started to believe there should be a way to express this functionally much like Java 8 Streams, and I had a vague idea what I was looking for. But as I studied JavaFX deeper, I became frustrated. I was being teased by JavaFX having Binding functionality that can synchronize properties and events of different controls, but the expression was very limited. 

One morning, someone on StackOverflow suggested I check out reactive programming and take a look at [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX), a reactive JavaFX library built by Tomas Mikula. This opened up my world and I discovered reactive programming for the first time. I played with the `EventStream` and was composing events and data together on a level playing field. It was awesome! I knew at that moment, reactive programming was the solution I was looking for. 

I originally set out to use reactive programming as a way to handle UI events, and ReactFX was perfect for this. However, I began to suspect I was missing the bigger picture. I researched reactive programming more and discovered [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), a reactive API with a rich ecosystem of libraries built around it, including the gem [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc). This library allows concise reactive SQL querying against a pool of JDBC connections using RxJava.  Sold! As someone who makes data-driven applications, this was a killer feature I *needed*. I realized in the reactive world events are data, and data are events! 

But how do I plug it into ReactFX?

To create a fully effective reactive solution, I needed RxJava to talk to ReactFX. I tried this task and it was wrought with problems. Technically it was difficult turning a ReactFX `EventStream` into an RxJava `Observable` and vice versa. I also realized ReactFX encourages doing everything on the JavaFX thread, but I wanted to switch between threads easily allowing concurrency. 

During my struggle I stumbled on the [RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX) project. It was a small library that converted `Node` and `ObservableValue` events into RxJava Observables. It also contained a `Scheduler` for the JavaFX thread. I knew immediately this was the alternative to ReactFX I needed, but some folks at Netflix were having some build issues with it. Ben Christensen was eager to give it away to someone who knew JavaFX, as nobody at Netflix used it. After a long period of no activity, I reluctantly volunteered to take ownership of it and I received the rights. I doubted my ability to solve the build issue, but after hours of Googling, trawling GitHub projects with similar issues, and making a few tweaks, it finally worked! I was able to get it released on Maven Central and RxJavaFX was now live. 

When I took ownership of the RxJavaFX library, I doubted it would progress beyond turning JavaFX `Node` events and `ObservableValue` changes into RxJava Observables. But I slowly learned there was much, much more to be done. JavaFX was built with event hooks everywhere, including collections like `ObservableList`. This provided all the tools needed to make a fully reactive API for JavaFX, and there was a lot of power to be unleashed in RxJavaFX. With random epiphanies as well as some guidance from the community, RxJavaFX has become a robust solution to integrate JavaFX into the RxJava ecosystem.

So let's get started!
