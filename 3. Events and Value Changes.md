# 3\. Events and Value Changes

In the previous chapter, we got a brief introduction to handling events reactively. But RxJavaFX is equipped to handle almost any event type for various `Node` controls. JavaFX also utilizes `Property` values, and their value changes can be turned into Observables easily as well.

## Turning JavaFX Events into Observables

To create an `Observable` for _any_ event on _any_ `Node`, you can target the `Node`'s events using a `JavaFxObservable.fromNodeEvents()` factory for Java, and the `Node` extension function `events()` for Kotlin. You can pass the `EventType` you are targeting as a parameter, and an `Observable` emitting that `EventType` will be returned.

Here is an example with a `ListView` containing `String` items representing the integers 0 through 9\. Whenever a numeric key is pressed on your keyboard, it will select that item in the `ListView` (Figure 3.1).

**Java**

```java

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();

        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            listView.getItems().add(String.valueOf(i));
        }

        JavaFxObservable.fromNodeEvents(listView, KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED)
                .map(KeyEvent::getCharacter)
                .filter(s -> s.matches("[0-9]"))
                .subscribe(s -> listView.getSelectionModel().select(s));

        vBox.getChildren().add(listView);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        listview<String> {
            (0..9).asSequence().map { it.toString() }.forEach { items.add(it) }

            events(KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED)
                .map { it.character }
                .filter { it.matches(Regex("[0-9]")) }
                .subscribe { selectionModel.select(it)}
        }
    }
}
```

Notice above we targeted `KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED` and the returned `Observable` will emit a `KeyEvent` item every time a `KEY_TYPED` event occurs. Some events like this one have helpful information on them, such as the character `String` representing the value for that key. We used a [regular expression](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9099/The-Minute-Regex-Tutorial) to validate the character `String` was a single numeric character, and filter emissions that are not. Then we selected it in the `ListView`'s `SelectionModel`.

> If you want to combine keystrokes to form entire Strings rather than a series of single characters, you will want to use [throttling, buffering, and switching  operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure) to combine them based on timing windows. We will cover these later in Chapter 8.

Here is another example that targets `MouseEvent.MOVE_MOVED` events on a `Rectangle`. As you move your cursor over the `Rectangle`, the `x` and `y` positions of the cursor will be concatenated and pushed into a `Label`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();

        Label positionLabel = new Label();
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(200,200);
        rectangle.setFill(Color.RED);

        JavaFxObservable.fromNodeEvents(rectangle, MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED)
                .map(me -> me.getX() + "-" +  me.getY())
                .subscribe(positionLabel::setText);

        vBox.getChildren().addAll(positionLabel,rectangle);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val positionLabel = label()

        rectangle(height = 200.0, width = 200.0) {

            fill = Color.RED

            events(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVED)
                .map { "${it.x}-${it.y}" }
                .subscribe { positionLabel.text = it }
        }
    }
}
```

JavaFX is packed with events everywhere, and you will need to know which events you are targeting on a given `Node` control. Be sure to look at the JavaDocs for the control you are using to see which event types you want to target.

Currently you can target events on `Node`, `Window`, and `Scene` types and there should be factories to support each one.

## ActionEvents

In the previous chapter we were exposed to the simple `ActionEvent`. You can actually target the `ActionEvent` using the events factory and emit them through an `Observable<ActionEvent>`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me!");

        JavaFxObservable.fromNodeEvents(button, ActionEvent.ACTION)
                .subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Pressed!"));

        vBox.getChildren().add(button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {
    override val root = hbox {
        button("Press Me")
            .events(ActionEvent.ACTION)
            .subscribe { println("Pressed!")}
    }
}
```

`ActionEvent` is a pretty common event that indicates a simple action was performed, like pressing a `Button` or `MenuItem`. It is so common that it is given its own factory as shown below, which is what we used in the previous chapter.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Button button = new Button("Press Me!");

        JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(button)
                .subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Pressed!"));

        vBox.getChildren().add(button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {
    override val root = hbox {
        button("Press Me")
            .actionEvents()
            .subscribe { println("Pressed!")}
    }
}
```

Currently, the `ActionEvent` factory supports `Button`, `MenuItem`, and `ContextMenu`.

## ObservableValue Changes

This is where reactive JavaFX will start to get interesting. Up to this point we only have worked with events. There is some metadata on event emissions that can be useful, but we are not quite pushing data.

JavaFX has many implementations of its `ObservableValue<T>` type. This is essentially a wrapper around a mutable value of a type `T`, and it notifies any listeners when the value changes. This provides a perfect opportunity to hook a listener onto it and make a reactive stream of value changes.

Create a simple UI with a `ComboBox<String>` and use the `JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue()` factory to emit its value changes in a hot `Observable`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        HBox hBox = new HBox();
        ComboBox<String> comboBox = new ComboBox<>();
        comboBox.getItems().setAll("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon");

        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(comboBox.valueProperty())
                .subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v + " was selected"));

        hBox.getChildren().add(comboBox);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(hBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = hbox {
        combobox<String> {

            items.setAll("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")

            valueProperty().toObservable()
                    .subscribe { println("$it was selected") }
        }
    }
}
```

When you select different items in the `ComboBox`, you should get a console output that looks something like this:

```
null was selected
Alpha was selected
Delta was selected
Epsilon was selected
```

For the next few examples, let's just focus on the `Observable` chain. Notice that the `JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue()` (or `toObservable()` for Kotlin) pushed a `null` value initially, even before we selected anything. This was the initial value for the `ComboBox`, and this factory will push that initial value when it first subscribes. If you want to skip the initial value, you may want to use the `skip()` operator to skip the first item (alternatively, you could also `filter()` out null values).

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(comboBox.valueProperty())
        .skip(1) //skips the first item
        .subscribe(v -> System.out.println(v + " was selected"));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
valueProperty().toObservable()
       .skip(1) //skips the first item
       .subscribe { println("$it was selected") }
```

Remember that we can use any RxJava operators! We can `map()` each String's `length()` and push that to the `Subscriber`.

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(comboBox.valueProperty())
        .skip(1) //skips the first item
        .map(String::length)
        .subscribe(i ->
            System.out.println("A String with length " + i + " was selected")
        );
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
valueProperty().toObservable()
        .skip(1)
        .map { it.length }
        .subscribe { println("A String with length $it was selected") }
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
A String with length 5 was selected
A String with length 4 was selected
A String with length 7 was selected
A String with length 4 was selected
```

Let's get a little crazier, and use `scan()` to do a rolling sum of the lengths with each emission.

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(comboBox.valueProperty())
        .skip(1) //skips the first item
        .map(String::length)
        .scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
        .subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Rolling length total: " + i));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
valueProperty().toObservable()
        .skip(1)
        .map { it.length }
        .scan(0,(x,y) -> x + y)
        .subscribe { println("Rolling length total: $it") }
```

When you make a few selections to the `ComboBox`, your output should look something like this dpeending on which Strings you selected.

**OUTPUT:**

```
Rolling length total: 0
Rolling length total: 5
Rolling length total: 10
Rolling length total: 17
Rolling length total: 22
Rolling length total: 26
Rolling length total: 31
```

This example may be a bit contrived, but hopefully you are starting to see some of the possibilities when you have a chain of operators "reacting" to a change in a `ComboBox`. Pushing each value every time it is selected in a `ComboBox` allows you to quickly tell Subscribers in the UI to update accordingly.

Again, you can use this factory on _any_ `ObservableValue`. This means you can hook into any JavaFX component property and track its changes reactively. The possibilities are quite endless. For instance, for every selection event in a `ComboBox`, you can query a database for items of that selection, and populate them into a `TableView`. Then that `TableView` may have Observables built off its events and properties to trigger other streams! We will see that in action later in this book.

> You might be wondering if making lots of `ComboBox` selections resulting in expensive queries could overwhelm the application. By default, yes that will happen. But in Chapter 8 we will learn how to switch, throttle, and buffer which will resolve this issue very effectively.

You also have the option of pushing the old and new value in a `Change` item through the `fromObservableValueChanges()` factory. This can be helpful for validation, and you can restore that old value back into the control if the new value fails to meet a condition.

For example, you can emit the old value and new value together on each typed character in a `TextField`. If at any moment the text is not numeric (or is an empty `String`), the previous value can be restored immediately using the `Subscriber`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        HBox hBox = new HBox();
        TextField textField = new TextField();

        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValueChanges(textField.textProperty())
                .map(s -> s.getNewVal().matches("|[0-9]+") ? s.getNewVal() : s.getOldVal())
                .subscribe(textField::setText);

        hBox.getChildren().add(textField);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(hBox));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = hbox {
        textfield {
            textProperty().toObservableChanges()
                .filter { !it.newVal.matches(Regex("|[0-9]+")) }
                .map { it.oldVal }
                .subscribe {
                    text = it
                }
        }
    }
}
```

If you study the `Observable` operation above, you can see that each `Change` item is emitted holding the old and new value for each text input. Using a regular expression, we validated for text inputs that are not numeric or are empty. We then `map()` it back to the old value and set it to the `TextField` in the `Subscriber`.

## Summary

In this chapter learned the basic RxJavaFX/RxKotlinFX factories to create RxJava Observables off JavaFX Events and ObservableValues. Definitely spend some time experimenting with this small but powerful set of factories that can be applied almost anywhere in the JavaFX API.

But there are a few more facilities we need to be truly productive and unleash the reactive power of JavaFX, starting next with JavaFX Collections. This is where the line between data and events truly become blurred in a beautiful way.
