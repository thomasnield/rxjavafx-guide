# 10. Decoupling Reactive Streams

In this book, we kept our examples fairly cohesive and did not bring any MVC (Model-View-Controller) or other UI code separation patterns. This was to keep the focus on Rx topics and not distract with any boilerplate. But in this chapter, we will introduce how you can separate Observables and Subscribers effectively so they do not know each other. This aids goals to create effective code separation patterns and increase maintainability of complex applications.

RxJavaFX has a key type called the `CompositeObservable` which assists in separating UI code from controllers, models, or whatever entities you prefer in your paradigm.
