# 10. Decoupling Reactive Streams

In this book, we kept our examples fairly cohesive and did not bring any UI code separation patterns. This was to keep the focus on Rx topics and not distract away from them. But in this chapter, we will introduce how you can separate Observables and Subscribers cleanly so they are not coupled with each other, even if they are in different parts of the UI. This aids goals to create effective code separation patterns and increase maintainability of complex applications.

RxJavaFX has an important type called the `CompositeObservable` which assists in separating UI code from controllers, models, or whatever entities you prefer in your paradigm. You can also use a [Subject](http://reactivex.io/documentation/subject.html), which is both an `Observable` and an `Observer`, to accomplish this. We did not cover Subjects in this book since they are a different Rx animal beyond the scope of this book. The `CompositeObservable` is backed by a `Subject` and streamlines its use for our purposes. It operates much like the  [EventBus found in Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained), but in a more Rx-friendly way.

## Using the CompositeObservable

A `CompositeObservable` acts as a proxy between one or more source Observables and one or more Subscribers. You can declare it by calling its constructor with the specified type it will receive/emit.

```kotlin
import rx.javafx.kt.addTo
import rx.javafx.kt.toObservable
import rx.javafx.sources.CompositeObservable
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    val textInputs = CompositeObservable<String>()

    override val root = vbox {
        textfield {
            textProperty().toObservable()
                    .addTo(textInputs)
        }

        label {
            textInputs.toObservable()
                    .map(String::reversed)
                    .subscribe { text = it }
        }
    }
}
```
