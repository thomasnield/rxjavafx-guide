# 6. Bindings, Dialogs, and Multicasting

There are situations where JavaFX will want a `Binding` rather than an RxJava `Observable` or `Subscriber`, and we will cover some streamlined utilities to meet this need. We will also cover JavaFX Dialogs and how to use them reactively. Finally we will encounter the concept of multicasting, an RxJava topic that will increasingly become critical as you advance in reactive JavaFX.


## Bindings and RxJava

In JavaFX, a `Binding` is an implementation of `ObservableValue` that is derived off other ObservableValues in some way. Bindings also allow you to synchronize JavaFX `ObservableValue` items through `bind()` and `bindBidirectional()` methods. You can express transformations of an `ObservableValue` and bind on those transformations, but RxJava expresses this task much more easily. As you probably observed, RxJavaFX provides a robust and expressive way to make controls communicate their changes.

For instance, you can leverage bindings to disable a `Button` when a `TextField` does not contain six characters.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox root = new VBox();

        Label label = new Label("Input a 6-character String");

        TextField input = new TextField();
        Button button = new Button("Proceed");

        button.disableProperty().bind(
                input.textProperty().length().isNotEqualTo(6)
        );
        root.getChildren().addAll(label,input,button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        label("Input a 6-character String")

        val input = textfield()
        val button = button("Proceed")

        button.disableProperty().bind(
                input.textProperty().length().isNotEqualTo(6)
        )
    }
}
```

Of course, the need for `Binding` in this case is eliminated thanks to RxJava. Knowing what you know now, RxJava creates a more streamlined and inuitive way to "push" the `input` text values, map them to a boolean expression, and finally sends them to a `Subscriber` that sets the `disableProperty()` of the `Button` .


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox root = new VBox();

        Label label = new Label("Input a 6-character String");

        TextField input = new TextField();
        Button button = new Button("Proceed");

        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(input.textProperty())
                .map(s -> s.length() != 6)
                .subscribe(b -> button.disableProperty().setValue(b));

        root.getChildren().addAll(label,input,button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        label("Input a 6-character String")

        val input = textfield()
        val button = button("Proceed")

        input.textProperty().toObservable()
            .map { it.length  != 6 }
            .subscribe { button.disableProperty().set(it) }
    }
}
```

If you are fluent in Rx, this is more intuitive than native JavaFX Bindings. It is also much flexible as a given `ObservableValue` remains openly mutable rather than being strictly bound to another `ObservableValue`. But there are times you will need to use Bindings to fully work with the JavaFX API. If you need to create a `Binding` off an RxJava `Observable`, there is a factory/extension function to turn an RxJava `Observable<T>` into a JavaFX `Binding<T>`. Let's take a look where Bindings are needed: TableViews.

Say you have the given domain type `Person`. It has a `birthday` property that holds a `LocalDate`. The `getAge()` is an `Observable<Long>` driven off of the `birthday` and is converted to a `Binding<Long>`. When you change the `birthday`, it will push a new `Long` value to the `Binding` (Figure 6.2).

**Java**

```java
public final class Person {

        private final StringProperty name;
        private final ObjectProperty<LocalDate> birthday;
        private final Binding<Long> age;

        Person(String name, LocalDate birthday) {
            this.name = new SimpleStringProperty(name);
            this.birthday = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(birthday);

            this.age = JavaFxSubscriber.toBinding(
                    JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(birthdayProperty())
                            .map(dt -> ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(dt,LocalDate.now()))
            );
        }

        public StringProperty nameProperty() {
            return name;
        }

        public ObjectProperty<LocalDate> birthdayProperty() {
            return birthday;
        }

        public Binding<Long> getAge() {
            return age;
        }
    }
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class Person(name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {
    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var birthday by property(birthday)
    fun birthdayProperty() = getProperty(Person::birthday)

    val age = birthdayProperty().toObservable()
            .map { ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(it,LocalDate.now()) }
            .toBinding()
}
```


Now if you put a few instances of these in a `TableView`, each row will then come to life (Figure 6.2).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        TableView<Person> table = new TableView<>();
        table.setEditable(true);

        table.getItems().setAll(
                new Person("Thomas Nield",LocalDate.of(1989,1,18)),
                new Person("Sam Tulsa",LocalDate.of(1980,5,12)),
                new Person("Ron Johnson",LocalDate.of(1975,3,8))
        );

        TableColumn<Person,String> nameCol = new TableColumn<>("Name");
        nameCol.setCellValueFactory(v -> v.getValue().nameProperty());

        TableColumn<Person,LocalDate> birthdayCol = new TableColumn<>("Birthday");
        birthdayCol.setCellValueFactory(v -> v.getValue().birthdayProperty());
        birthdayCol.setCellFactory(TextFieldTableCell.forTableColumn(new LocalDateStringConverter()));

        TableColumn<Person,Long> ageCol = new TableColumn<>("Age");
        ageCol.setCellValueFactory(v -> v.getValue().getAge());

        table.getColumns().addAll(nameCol,birthdayCol,ageCol);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(table));
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView: View() {

    override val root = tableview<Person> {
        isEditable = true
        items.setAll(
                Person("Thomas Nield",LocalDate.of(1989,1,18)),
                Person("Sam Tulsa",LocalDate.of(1980,5,12)),
                Person("Ron Johnson",LocalDate.of(1975,3,8))
        )

        column("Name",Person::nameProperty)
        column("Birthday",Person::birthdayProperty)
                .useTextField(LocalDateStringConverter())
        column("Age",Person::age)
    }
}
```

**Figure 6.2**

![](http://i.imgur.com/dZhI7C1.png)

When you edit the "Birthday" field for a given row, you will see the "Age" field update automatically. This is because the age `Binding` is subscribed to the RxJava `Observable` derived from the birthday `Property`.

### Handling Errors with Reactive Bindings

When you create a JavaFX `Binding<T>` off an `Observable<T>`, it usually is a good idea to pass a lambda to handle the `onError()` event. Otherwise errors may go unnoticed and unhandled. Try to make this part of your best practices, even if we do not do this for the rest of the book (for sake of brevity).

**Java**

```java
private final Binding<Long> age = JavaFxSubscriber.toBinding(
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(birthdayProperty())
          .map(dt -> ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(dt,LocalDate.now())),
        Throwable::printStackTrace
        );
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val age = birthdayProperty().toObservable()
        .map { ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(it,LocalDate.now()) }
        .toBinding { it.printStackTrace() }
```


### Disposing Bindings

If we are going to remove records from a `TableView`. we will need to dispose any Bindings that exist on each item. This will `unsubscribe()` the `Binding` from the RxJava `Observable` to prevent any memory leaks and free resources.

It is good practice to put a method on your domain type that will dispose all Bindings on that item. For our `Person`, we will want to `dispose()` the age `Binding` when that `Person` is no longer needed.

**Java**

```java
public final class Person {

    // existing code

    public void dispose() {
        age.dispose();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class Person(name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {

    //existing code

    fun dispose() = age.dispose()
}
```

Whever you remove items from the `TableView`, call `dispose()` on each `Person` so all Observables are unsubscribed. If your domain type has several Bindings, you can add them all to a `CompositeBinding`. This is basically a collection of Bindings that you can `dispose()` all at once. Say we added another `Binding` to `Person` called `isAdult` (which is conveniently built off `age` by turning it into an `Observable`). It may be convenient to add both Bindings to a `CompositeBinding` in the constructor, so `dispose()` will dispose them both.

**Java**

```java
public final class Person {

    private final StringProperty name;
    private final ObjectProperty<LocalDate> birthday;
    private final Binding<Long> age;
    private final Binding<Boolean> isAdult;

    private final CompositeBinding bindings = new CompositeBinding();

    Person(String name, LocalDate birthday) {
        this.name = new SimpleStringProperty(name);
        this.birthday = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(birthday);

        this.age = JavaFxSubscriber.toBinding(
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(birthdayProperty())
                        .map(dt -> ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(dt,LocalDate.now()))
        );

        this.isAdult = JavaFxSubscriber.toBinding(
                JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(age)
                    .map(age -> age >= 18)
        );

        bindings.add(age);
        bindings.add(isAdult);
    }

    public StringProperty nameProperty() {
        return name;
    }

    public ObjectProperty<LocalDate> birthdayProperty() {
        return birthday;
    }

    public Binding<Long> getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void dispose() {
        bindings.dispose();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class Person(name: String, birthday: LocalDate) {
    var name by property(name)
    fun nameProperty() = getProperty(Person::name)

    var birthday by property(birthday)
    fun birthdayProperty() = getProperty(Person::birthday)

    private val bindings = CompositeBinding()

    val age = birthdayProperty().toObservable()
            .map { ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(it,LocalDate.now()) }
            .toBinding { it.printStackTrace() }
            .addTo(bindings)

    val isAdult = age.toObservable()
            .map { it >= 18 }
            .toBinding { it.printStackTrace() }
            .addTo(bindings)

    fun dispose() = bindings.dispose()
}
```

### Lazy Bindings

When you create a `Binding<T>` off an `Observable<T>`, it will subscribe eagerly and request emissions immediately. There may be situtations you would rather a `Binding<T>` be lazy and not subscribe to the `Observable<T>` until a value is first needed (specifically, when `getValue()` is called). This is particularly helpful for data controls like `TableView` where only visible records in view will request values. If you scroll quickly, it will only request values when you slow down on a set of records. This way, the `TableView` does not have to calculate all values for all records, but rather just the ones you see.

If we wanted to make our two reactive Bindings on `Person` lazy, so they only subscribe when that `Person` is in view, call `toLazyBinding()` instead of `toBinding()`.

**Java**

```java
this.age = JavaFxSubscriber.toLazyBinding(
        JavaFxObservable.fromObservableValue(birthdayProperty())
                .map(dt -> ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(dt,LocalDate.now()))
);
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val age = birthdayProperty().toObservable()
        .map { ChronoUnit.YEARS.between(it,LocalDate.now()) }
        .toLazyBinding { it.printStackTrace() }
        .addTo(bindings)
```

In some situations, you may have a `Binding` that is driven off an `Observable` that queries a database (using [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc)) or some other service. Because these requests can be expensive, `toLazyBinding()` can be very valuable to initiatlize the `TableView` more quickly. Of course, this lazy loading can sometimes cause laggy scrolling by holding up the JavaFX thread, and we will learn about concurrency in the next chapter to mitigate this.

## Dialogs

[JavaFX Dialogs](http://code.makery.ch/blog/javafx-8-dialogs/) are popups to quickly show a message to the user or solicit an input. They can be helpful in reactive applications, so they also have a factory to turn their response into an `Observable`.

You can pass an `Alert` or `Dialog` to the `fromDialog()` factory, and it will return an `Observable` that emits the response as a single emission. Then it will call `onCompleted()`.

**Java**

```java
JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
    new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to do this?")
).subscribe(response -> System.out.println("You pressed " + response.getText()));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to do this?")
   .toObservable()
   .subscribe { println("You pressed " + response.text) }
```
Dialogs can become more useful in a `flatMap()` to intercept and manipulate emissions. If you `flatMap()` a `Button`'s ActionEvents to a `Dialog` response, you can use `filter()` on the response to conditionally allow an emission to go forward or be suppressed.

For example, say you have a "Run Process" `Button` that will kick of a simple process  emitting the integers 1 through 10, and then collects them into a `List`. Pretend this process was something more intensive, and you want the user to confirm on pressing the `Button` if they want to run it. You can use a `Dialog` to intercept `ActionEvent` emissions in a `flatMap()`, map to the `Dialog`'s response, and allow only emissions that are `ButtonType.OK`. Then you can `flatMap()` that emission to kick off the process (Figure 6.3).


**Java**

```java

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Button runButton = new Button("Run Process");

        JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(runButton)
                .flatMap(ae ->
                        JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to run the process?"))
                            .filter(response -> response.equals(ButtonType.OK))
                ).flatMap(response -> Observable.range(1,10).toList())
                .subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Processed integer list: " + i));

        VBox root = new VBox();
        root.getChildren().add(runButton);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {
        button("Run Process").actionEvents()
            .flatMap {
                Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to run the process?")
                    .toObservable()
                    .filter { it == ButtonType.OK }
            }.flatMap { Observable.range(1,10).toList() }
            .subscribe { println("Processed integer list: $it") }
    }
}
```


**Figure 6.3**

![](http://i.imgur.com/U0iX3Cg.png)

That `flatMap()` to an `Alert` dialog will emit a `ButtonData.OK` or `ButtonData.CANCEL` response depending on what the user chooses. Filtering for only `ButtonData.OK` emissions, only those emissions will result in a kickoff of the `.flatMap { Observable.range(1,10).toList() }` process. Otherwise it will be empty and no `List<Integer>` will be emitted at all. This shows we can use a `Dialog` or `Alert` inputs to intercept and manipulate emissions in an `Observable` chain.


Here is another example. Let's say clicking a `Button` will emit an `ActionEvent`. You will then have integers 0 through 10 emitted inside a `flatMap()` for each `ActionEvent`, and you want the user to decide which integers should proceed to the `Subscriber`. Using some creative flatmapping, this is not terribly hard. You can use an `Alert` or `Dialog` for each integer emission to control which ones will go forward (Figure 6.4).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Button runButton = new Button("Run Process");

        JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(runButton)
                .flatMap(ae ->
                        Observable.range(1,10)
                            .flatMap(i ->
                                    JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                                            new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,
                                                    "Are you sure you want to process integer " + i + "?",
                                                    ButtonType.NO, ButtonType.YES)
                                            ).filter(response -> response.equals(ButtonType.YES))
                                            .map(response -> i)
                            )

                ).subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Processed integer: " + i));

        VBox root = new VBox();
        root.getChildren().add(runButton);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {
        button("Run Process").actionEvents()
                .flatMap {
                    Observable.range(1, 10).flatMap { i ->
                        Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,
                                "Do you want to process integer $i?",
                                ButtonType.NO, ButtonType.YES
                        ).toObservable()
                        .filter { it == ButtonType.YES }
                        .map { response -> i }
                    }
                }.subscribe { println("Processed integer: $it") }
    }
}
```

**Figure 6.4**

![](http://i.imgur.com/Np5DLwb.png)

The `.map(response -> i)` is a simple trick you can do to take a response after it has been filtered, and map it back to the integer. If you say "YES" to 1, 3, 6 and "NO" to everything else, you should get the output above. 2,4,5,7,9, and 10 never made it to the `Subscriber` because "NO" was selected and filterd out.

That is how you can reactively leverage Dialogs and Alerts, and any control that implements `Dialog` to return a single result can be reactively emitted in this way.


### Multicasting

For the sake of keeping the previous chapters accessible, I might have mislead you when I said UI events are hot Observables. The truth is they are a gray area between a hot and cold `Observable` (or should I say "warm"?). Remember, a "hot" `Observable` will emit to all Subscribers at once, while a "cold" `Observable` will replay emissions to each `Subscriber`. This is a pragmatic way to separate the two, but UI event factories in RxJavaFX (as well as RxAndroid) awkwardly operate as both hot and cold unless you **multicast**, or force an emission to hotly be emitted to all Subscribers.

To understand this subtle impact, here is a trick question. Say you have an `Observable` driven off a `Dialog` or `Alert`, and it has two Subscribers. Do you think the response is going to go to both Subscribers?

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Observable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));


        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        System.exit(0)
    }

Try running it and you will see the `Alert` popup twice, once for each `Subscriber`. This is almost like it's a cold `Observable` and it is "replaying" the `Dialog` procedure for each `Subscriber`. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what is happening. Both Subscribers are receiving their own, independent streams. You can actually say `OK` on one `Subscriber` and `CANCEL` to the other. The two Subscribers are, in fact, not receiving the same emission as you would expect in a hot `Observable`.

This behavior is not a problem when you have one `Subscriber`. But when you have multiple Subscribers, you will start to realize this is not a 100% hot `Observable`. It is "hot" in that previous emissions are missed by tardy Subscribers, but it is not "hot" in that a single set of emissions are going to all Subscribers. To force the latter to happen, you can multicast, and that will force this `Observable` to be 100% hot.

One way to multicast is to use the  `ConnectableObservable` we used in Chapter 2. We can `publish()` the `Observable` to get a `ConnectableObservable`, set up up the `Subscribers`, *then* call `connect()` to start firing the same emissions to all Subscribers.


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        ConnectableObservable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK))
         .publish();

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));

        response.connect();

        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin

class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }
            .publish()

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        response.connect()

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

When you run this program, you will now see the `Alert` only pop up once, and the single response will go to both Subscribers simultaneously. Every operator *before* the `publish()` will be a single stream of emissions. But take note that everything *after* the `publish()` is subject to be on separate streams from that point.

If you want this `ConnectableObservable` to automatically `connect()` for you when the first `Subscriber` is subscribed, you can call `refCount()` ot turn it back into an `Observable`.

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        Observable<Boolean> response = JavaFxObservable.fromDialog(
                new Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION,"Are you sure you want to proceed?")
        ).map(r -> r.equals(ButtonType.OK))
         .publish()
         .refCount();

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 received: " + r));

        response.subscribe(r -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 received: " + r));

        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

        val response = Alert(Alert.AlertType.CONFIRMATION, "Are you sure you want to proceed?")
            .toObservable()
            .map { it == ButtonType.OK }
            .publish()
            .refCount()

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 received: $it") }

        response.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 received: $it") }

        System.exit(0)
    }
}
```

`refCount()` is a convenient way to turn a `ConnectableObservable` back into an automatic `Observable`. It is helpful to force emissions to be hot without manually calling `connect()`. Just be aware it will start emitting on the first subscription, and any following subscriptions may miss the first emissions as they are subscribed *after* the firing starts. But for UI events waiting for a user input, chances are all subscriptions will `connect()` in time before the user inputs anything, so `refCount()` is usually acceptable for UI events. But if your Observable is going to fire emissions the moment it is subscribed, you may just want to manually set up a `ConnectableObservable`, subscribe the Subscribers, and call `connect()` yourself.

So when should you multicast with a `ConnectableObservable` (or its `refCount()`)? The answer is when you have multiple Subscribers to a single UI event `Observable`. When you broadcast something as simple as a `Button`'s ActionEvents, it is more efficient to multicast it so it does not create a `Listener` for each `Subscriber`, but rather consolidates to one `Listener`.

Here is proof. Let's create two Subscribers to a `Button`'s actionEvents. Put a `doOnSubscribe()` operator that will print a notification that the `Observable` is being subscribed at that point in the chain. If you do it without the `publish().refCount()`, you will see the `doOnSubscribe()` will print the message twice, indicating that there are two subscription streams going on (and hence two Listeners). But if you include the `publish().refCount()`, you will see it print only once, indicating that both Subscribers are listening to the same stream.

**Java**

```java

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        Button button = new Button("Press Me");

        Observable<ActionEvent> clickEvents = JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(button)
                .doOnSubscribe(() -> System.out.println("Subscribing!"))
                .publish().refCount();

        clickEvents.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 fired!"));
        clickEvents.subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 fired!"));

        root.getChildren().add(button);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View() {

    override val root = vbox {

       val clickEvents = button("Press Me")
               .actionEvents()
               .doOnSubscribe { println("Subscribing!") }
               .publish().refCount()

        clickEvents.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 fired!") }
        clickEvents.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 fired!") }
    }
}
```

Again, use multicasting for UI event Observables when there is more than one Subscriber. Even though most of the time this makes no functional difference, it is more efficient. It also will prevent subtle misbehaviors like we saw in cases like the `Dialog`, where we want to force a single emission stream to go to all Subscribers rather than each Subscriber getting its own emissions in a cold-like manner. If you have only one `Subscriber`, the additional overhead of `ConnectableObservable` is not necessary.


### Summary
If you got this far, congrats! We have covered a lot. In this chapter we learned about turning Observables into JavaFX Bindings, which helps interop RxJava with JavaFX more thoroughly. We ran through reactive usage of Dialogs, which you can use to intercept emissions and get a user input for each one, as well as multicasting. The topic of multicasting is a critical one to understand because UI Observables do not always act hot when multiple Subscribers are subscribed. Creating a `ConnectableObservable` is an effective way to force an `Observable` to become hot and ensure each emission goes to all Subscribers at once.

Make sure you are somewhat comfortable with the material we covered so far, because next we are going to cover concurrency. This is the topic that everything leads up to, as RxJava revolutionizes how we multithread safely and robustly.
