# 8. Concurrency

Concurrency has become a critical skill in software development. Most computers and smart phones now have multiple core processors, and this means the most effective way to scale performance is to leverage all of them. For this full utilization to happen, code must explicitly be coded for multiple threads that can be worked by multiple cores.

The idea of concurrency is essentially multitasking. Multiple threads execute multiple tasks at the same time. Suppose you had some yard work to do and had three tasks: mow the lawn, trim the trees, and sweep the patio. If you are working alone, there is no way you can do all three of these tasks at the same time. You have to sequentially work on each task one-at-a-time. But if you had two friends or family members to help out, you can get done more quickly as all three of you can execute all three tasks simultaneously. In essense, each person is a thread and each yard chore is a task.

Even if you have only one other person to help, the two of you can tackle two of the tasks immediately. The first one to get done can then move on to the third task. This is essentially what a thread pool does. It has a fixed number of threads and is given a "queue" of tasks to do. Each thread will take a task, execute it, and then take another. "Reusing" threads and giving them a queue of tasks, rather than creating a thread for each task, is usually more efficient since threads are expensive.

Traditionally, concurrency is difficult to master in Java. A lot can go wrong especially with mutable variables being accessed by multiple threads. Thankfully, RxJava makes concurrency much easier and safer. When you stay within an `Observable` chain, it does not matter what thread emissions happen on. Of course, when you have operations and Subscribers affecting JavaFX UI's, you will need those to happen on the JavaFX thread. But one of the selling points of RxJava is concurrency is trivial to compose, and this is helpful to make JavaFX UI's responsive and non-freezing.

>It is recommended to study concurrency without RxJava, just so you are aware of the "gotchas" that can happen with multithreading. Benjamin Winterberg has an [awesome online tutorial](http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/04/07/java8-concurrency-tutorial-thread-executor-examples/) walking through Java 8 concurrency. If you want deep knowlege in Java concurrnecy, [Java Concurrency in Practice](http://jcip.net/) is an involved but very informative book.

## Using the `subscribeOn()`

By default, for a given `Observable` chain the thread that calls the `subscribe()` method is the thread the `Observable` sends emissions on.
