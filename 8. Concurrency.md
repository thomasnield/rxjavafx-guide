# 8. Concurrency

Concurrency has become a critical skill in software development. Most computers and smart phones now have multiple core processors, and this means the most effective way to scale performance is to leverage all of them. For this full utilization to happen, code must explicitly be coded for multiple threads that can be worked by multiple cores.

The idea of concurrency is essentially multitasking. Multiple threads execute multiple tasks at the same time. Suppose you had some yard work to do and had three tasks: mow the lawn, trim the trees, and sweep the patio. If you are working alone, there is no way you can do all three of these tasks at the same time. You have to sequentially work on each task one-at-a-time. But if you had two friends to help out, you can get done more quickly as all three of you can execute all three tasks simultaneously. In essence, each person is a thread and each chore is a task.

Even if you have less threads than tasks (such as two threads and three tasks), the two threads can tackle two of the tasks immediately. The first one to get done can then move on to the third task. This is essentially what a thread pool does. It has a fixed number of threads and is given a "queue" of tasks to do. Each thread will take a task, execute it, and then take another. "Reusing" threads and giving them a queue of tasks, rather than creating a thread for each task, is usually more efficient since threads are expensive to create and dispose.

Traditionally, Java concurrency is difficult to master. A lot can go wrong especially with mutable variables being accessed by multiple threads. Thankfully, RxJava makes concurrency easier and safer. When you stay within an `Observable` chain, it does not matter what thread emissions get pushed on (except of course Observers and operators affecting JavaFX UI's, which need to happen on the JavaFX thread). A major selling point of RxJava is its ability to make concurrency trivial to compose, and this is helpful to make JavaFX UI's responsive and resilient.

> It is recommended to study concurrency without RxJava, just so you are aware of the "gotchas" that can happen with multithreading. Benjamin Winterberg has an [awesome online tutorial](http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/04/07/java8-concurrency-tutorial-thread-executor-examples/\) walking through Java 8 concurrency. If you want deep knowlege in Java concurrnecy, [Java Concurrency in Practice]\(http://jcip.net/) is an excellent book to gain low-level knowledge.

## Using `subscribeOn()`

By default, for a given `Observable` chain, the thread that calls the `subscribe()` method is the thread the `Observable` sends emissions on. For instance, a simple subscription to an `Observable` inside a `main()` method will fire the emissions on the `main` daemon thread.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;

public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.range(1,5)
                .subscribe(i ->
                        System.out.println("Receiving " + i + " on thread "
                                + Thread.currentThread().getName())
                );
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import io.reactivex.Observable

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    Observable.range(1,5)
            .subscribe { println("Receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Receiving 1 on thread main
Receiving 2 on thread main
Receiving 3 on thread main
Receiving 4 on thread main
Receiving 5 on thread main
```

However, we can easily switch these emissions to happen on another thread using `subscribeOn()`. We can pass a `Scheduler` as an argument, which specifies where it gets a thread from. In this case we can pass `subscribeOn()` an argument of `Schedulers.newThread()`, so it will execute on a new thread for each `Observer`.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.range(1,5)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
                .subscribe(i ->
                        System.out.println("Receiving " + i + " on thread "
                                + Thread.currentThread().getName())
                );

        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    Observable.range(1,5)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
            .subscribe { println("Receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
```

This way we can declare our `Observable` chain and an `Observer`, but then immediately move on without waiting for the emissions to finish. Those are now happening on a new thread named `RxNewThreadScheduler-1`. Notice too we have to call `TimUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)` afterwards to make the `main` thread sleep for 3 seconds. This gives our `Observable` a chance to fire all emissions before the program exits. You should not have to do this `sleep()` with a JavaFX application since its own non-daemon threads will keep the session alive.

A critical behavior to note here is that _all_ emissions are happening _sequentially_ on a single `RxNewThreadScheduler-1` thread. Emissions are strictly happening one-at-a-time on a single thread. There is no parallelization or racing to call `onNext()` throughout the chain. If this did occur, it would break the [`Observable` contract](http://reactivex.io/documentation/contract.html\). It may surprise some folks to hear that RxJava is not parallel, but we will cover some concurrency tricks with `flatMap()`later to get parallelization without breaking the`Observable` contract.

`subscribeOn()` can be declared anywhere in the `Observable` chain, and it will communicate all the way up to the source what thread to fire emissions on. If you pointlessly declare multiple `subscribeOn()` operators in a chain, the left-most one (closest to the source) will win. Later we will cover the `observeOn()` which can switch emissions to a different thread in the middle of the chain.

### Pooling Threads: Choosing a Scheduler

In reality, you should be conservative about using `Schedulers.newThread()` as it creates a new thread for each `Observer`. You will notice that if we attach multiple Observers to this `Observable`, we are going to create a new thread for each `Observer`.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread());

        //Observer 1
        source.subscribe(i ->
                System.out.println("Observer 1 receiving " + i + " on thread "
                        + Thread.currentThread().getName())
        );

        //Observer 2
        source.subscribe(i ->
                System.out.println("Observer 2 receiving " + i + " on thread "
                        + Thread.currentThread().getName())
        );

        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val source = Observable.range(1,5)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())

    //Observer 1
    source.subscribe { println("Observer 1 receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    //Observer 2
    source.subscribe { println("Observer 2 receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Observer 2 receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Observer 1 receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Observer 2 receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Observer 1 receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Observer 2 receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Observer 1 receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Observer 2 receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Observer 1 receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Observer 2 receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Observer 1 receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
```

Now we have two threads, `RxNewThreadScheduler-1` and `RxNewThreadScheduler-2`. What if we had 100, or even 1000 Observers? This can easily happen if you are flatMapping to hundreds or thousands of Observables each with their own `subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())`.  Threads are very expensive and can tax your machine, so we want to constrain the number of threads that can be used at a time.

The most effective way to keep thread creation under control is to "reuse" threads. You can do this with the different `Schedulers`. A `Scheduler` is RxJava's equivalent to [Java's standard `Executor`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/executorservice.html\). You can create your own `Scheduler` by passing an `Executor` to the `Schedulers.from()`factory. But for most cases, it is better to use RxJava's standard`Schedulers` as they are optimized to be conservative and efficient for most cases.

#### Computation

If you are doing computation-intensive operations, you will likely want to use `Schedulers.computation()` which will maintain a conservative number of threads to keep the CPU from being taxed.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation());
```

`Observable` operations that are doing calculation and algorithm-heavy work are optimal to use with the computation `Scheduler`. If you are not sure how many threads will be created by a process, you might want to make this one your go-to.

#### IO

If you are doing a lot of IO-related tasks, like sending web requests or database queries, these are much less taxing on the CPU and threads can be created more liberally. `Schedulers.io()` is suited for this kind of work. It will add and remove threads depending on how much work is being thrown at it at a given time, and reuse threads as much as possible.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io());
```

But be careful as it will not limit how many threads it creates! As a rule-of-thumb, assume it will create a new thread for each task.

#### Immediate

The `Schedulers.immediate()` is the default `Scheduler`, and it will work execute work on the immediate thread declaring the `Observer`.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate());
```

You will likely not use this `Scheduler` very often since it is the default. The code above is no different than declaring an `Observable` with no `subscribeOn()`.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
```

#### Trampoline

An interesting `Scheduler` is the `Schedulers.trampoline()`. It will schedule the emissions to happen on the immediate thread, but allow the immediate thread to finish its current task first. In other words, this defers execution of the emissions but will fire them the moment the current thread declaring the subscription is no longer busy.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.trampoline());
```

You will likely not use the Trampoline Scheduler unless you encounter nuanced situations where you have to manage complex operations on a single thread and [starvation can occur](goo.gl/xz2ND5). The JavaFX Scheduler uses a trampoline mechanism, which we will cover next.

#### JavaFX Scheduler

Finally, the `JavaFxScheduler` is packaged with the RxJavaFX library. It executes the emissions on the JavaFX thread so they can safely make modifications to a UI. It uses a trampoline policy against the JavaFX thread, making it highly resilient against recursive hangups and thread starvation.

The JavaFX Scheduler is not in the `Schedulers` class, but rather is stored as a singleton in its own class. You can call it like below:

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform());
```

In Kotlin, The RxKotlinFX library can save you some boilerplate by using an extension function instead.

```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOnFx()
```

At the time of writing, all RxJavaFX/RxKotlinFX factories already emit on the `JavaFxScheduler`. Therefore, declaring a `subscribeOn()` against these sources will have no affect. You will need to leverage `observeOn()` to switch to another thread later in the chain, which we will cover shortly.

**Java**

```java
Button button = new Button("Press me");

JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // has no effect
        .subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("You clicked me!"));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val button = Button("Press me")

button.actionEvents()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // has no effect
        .subscribe { println("You clicked me!") }
```

Also note that the JavaFX Scheduler is already used when declaring UI code, and will be the default `subscribeOn()` Scheduler since it is the immediate thread. Therefore, you will rarely call `subscribeOn()` to specify the JavaFxScheduler. You are more likely to use it with `observeOn()`.

### Intervals

While we are talking about concurrency, it is worth mentioning there are other factories that already emit on a specific `Scheduler`. For instance, there are factories in both RxJava and RxJavaFX to emit at a specified time interval.

In RxJava, there is an `Observable.interval()` that will emit a consecutive `Long` at every specified time interval. By default, this runs on the `Schedulers.computation()` unless you specify a different one as a third argument.

Here is an application that will increment a `Label` every second (Figure 8.1).

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        Label label = new Label();

        Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS, JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                .map(Object::toString)
                .subscribe(label::setText);

        root.getChildren().add(label);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.setMinWidth(60);
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler
import tornadofx.*
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit


class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        minWidth = 60.0

        label {
            Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS, JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                    .map { it.toString() }
                    .subscribe { text = it }
        }
    }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**Figure 8.1**

> You can also use `JavaFxScheduler.interval()` to pass a `Duration` instead of a `TimeUnit`, and not have to specify the JavaFX Scheduler.

Intervals are helpful to create timer-driven Observables, or perform tasks such as scheduling jobs or periodically driving refreshes. If you want all Observers to not receive separate interval streams, be sure to use `publish().refCount()` or `publish().autoConnect()` to multicast the same interval timer to all Observers downstream.

## Using `observeOn()`

A lot of folks get confused by the difference between `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()`, but the distinction is quite simple. A `subsribeOn()` instructs the source `Observable` what thread to emit items on. However, the `observeOn()` switches emissions to a different thread _at that point_ in the chain.

In JavaFX, the most common useage of `observeOn()` is to put items back on the JavaFX thread after a compution or IO operation finishes from another thread. Say you wanted to import some expensive data on `Schedulers.io()` and collect it in a `List`. Once it is ready, you want to move that `List` emission to the JavaFX thread to feed a `ListView`. That is perfectly doable with an `observeOn()` (Figure 8.2).

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.ListView;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                .subscribe(list -> listView.getItems().setAll(list));

        root.getChildren().add(listView);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.observeOnFx
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.rxkotlin.subscribeBy
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import tornadofx.*

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        listview<String> {
            Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                    .toList()
                    .observeOnFx()
                    .subscribeBy { items.setAll(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.2**

![](http://i.imgur.com/aCJeQ2X.png)

The five Strings are emitted and collected into a `List` on a `Schedulers.io()` thread. But immediately after the `toList()` is an `observeOn()` that takes that `List` and emits it on the JavaFX Scheduler. Unlike the `subscribeOn()` where placement does not matter, the placement of the `observeOn()` does. It switches to a different thread _at that point_ in the Observable chain.

This all happens a bit too fast to see this occuring, so let's exaggerate this example and emulate a long-running database query or request. Use the `delay()` operator to delay the emissions by 3 seconds. Note that `delay()` subscribes on the `Schedulers.computation()` by default, so having a `subscribeOn()` no longer has any effect. But we can pass the `Schedulers.io()` as a third argument to make it use an IO thread instead (Figure 8.3).

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.ListView;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        Observable.just("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma", "Delta", "Epsilon")
                .delay(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                .subscribe(list -> listView.getItems().setAll(list));

        root.getChildren().add(listView);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.observeOnFx
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.rxkotlin.subscribeBy
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import tornadofx.*
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        listview<String> {
            Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                    .delay(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io())
                    .toList()
                    .observeOnFx()
                    .subscribeBy { items.setAll(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.3**

![](http://i.imgur.com/HWH8Kit.png\) ![]\(http://i.imgur.com/DaEOAZZ.png)

In Figure 8.3, notice that our UI is empty for 3 seconds before it is finally populated. The data importing and collecting into a `List` happens on the IO thread, and then it is safely emitted back on the JavaFX thread where it is populated into the `ListView`. The JavaFX thread does not hold up the UI from displaying due to this operation keeping it busy. If we had more controls we would see the UI is completely interactive as well during this background operation.

### Chaining Multiple `observeOn()` Calls

It is also not uncommon to use multiple `observeOn()` calls. Here is a more real-life example: let's say you want to create an application that displays a text response (such as JSON) from a URL. This has the potential to create an unrespsonsive application that freezes while it is fetching the request. But using an `observeOn()` we can switch this work from the FX thread to an IO therad, then call another `observeOn()` afterwards to put it back on the FX thread.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.observables.JavaFxObservable;
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextArea;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MyApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Label label = new Label("Input URL");
        TextField input = new TextField();
        TextArea output = new TextArea();
        Button button = new Button("Submit");

        output.setWrapText(true);

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .map(ae -> input.getText())
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .map(MyApp::getResponse)
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                .subscribe(output::setText);

        vBox.getChildren().setAll(label,input,output,button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();

    }
    private static String getResponse(String path) {
        try {
            return new Scanner(new URL(path).openStream(), "UTF-8").useDelimiter("\\A").next();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return e.getMessage();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.actionEvents
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.observeOnFx
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import tornadofx.*
import java.net.URL

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root =  vbox {

        label("Input URL")
        val input = textfield()
        val output = textarea {
            isWrapText = true
        }

        button("Submit").actionEvents()
                .map { input.text }
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .map {
                    URL(input.text).readText()
                }.observeOnFx()
                .subscribe {
                    output.text = it
                }
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.4**

![](http://i.imgur.com/z8Lv7hM.png)

You can then put in a URL in the `TextField` (such as "[https://api.github.com/users/thomasnield/starred](https://api.github.com/users/thomasnield/starred)") and then click the "Submit" `Button` to process it. You will notice the UI stays interactive and after a few seconds it will put the response in the `TextArea` (Figure 8.5).

**Figure 8.5**

![](http://i.imgur.com/1PHm7W1.png)

Of course, you can click the "Submit" `Button` multiple times and that could queue up the requests in an undesirable way. But at least the work is kept off the UI thread. In the next chapter we will learn about the `switchMap()` to mitigate excessive user inputs and kill previous requests, so only the latest emission is chased after.

But we will take a stateful strategy for now to prevent this from happening.

### doOnXXXFx() Operators

Remember the `doOnXXX()` operators like `doOnNext()`, `doOnComplete()`, etc? RxKotlinFX has JavaFX equivalents that will perform on the FX thread, regardless of which `Scheduler` is being used. This can be helpful to modify UI elements in the middle of an `Observable` chain.

For example, you might want to disable the `Button` and change its text during processing. Your first instinct might be to use the `doOnNext()` to achieve this.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.observables.JavaFxObservable;
import io.reactivex.rxjavafx.schedulers.JavaFxScheduler;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.control.TextArea;
import javafx.scene.control.TextField;
import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class JavaFxApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
        VBox vBox = new VBox();
        Label label = new Label("Input URL");
        TextField input = new TextField();
        TextArea output = new TextArea();
        Button button = new Button("Submit");

        output.setWrapText(true);

        JavaFxObservable.actionEventsOf(button)
                .map(ae -> input.getText())
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .doOnNext(path -> {
                    button.setText("BUSY");
                    button.setDisable(true);
                })
                .map(JavaFxApp::getResponse)
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.platform())
                .subscribe(r -> {
                    output.setText(r);
                    button.setText("Submit");
                    button.setDisable(false);
                });

        vBox.getChildren().setAll(label,input,output,button);
        stage.setScene(new Scene(vBox));
        stage.show();

    }
    private static String getResponse(String path) {
        try {
            return new Scanner(new URL(path).openStream(), "UTF-8").useDelimiter("\\A").next();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return e.getMessage();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.actionEvents
import com.github.thomasnield.rxkotlinfx.observeOnFx
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers
import tornadofx.*
import java.net.URL

class MyApp: App(MyView::class)

class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root =  vbox {

        label("Input URL")
        val input = textfield()
        val output = textarea {
            isWrapText = true
        }

        val submitButton = button("Submit")

        submitButton.actionEvents()
                .map { input.text }
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .doOnNext {
                    submitButton.text = "BUSY"
                    submitButton.isDisable = true
                }
                .map {
                    URL(input.text).readText()
                }.observeOnFx()
                .subscribe {
                    output.text = it
                    submitButton.text = "Submit"
                    submitButton.isDisable = false
                }
    }
}
```

But if you try to execute a request this way, you will get an error indicating that the `submitButton` is not being modified on the FX thread. This is occuring because an IO thread (not the FX thread) is trying to modify the `Button`. You could move this `doOnNext()` operator before the `observeOn(Schedulers.io())` so it catches the FX thread, and that would address the issue. But there will be times where you must call a `doOnNext()` deep in an `Observable` chain that is already on another thread (such as updating a `ProgressBar`).

In RxKotlinFX, there are `doOnXXXFx()` operator equivalents that run on the JavaFX thread, regardless of which thread the operator is called on. You can achieve this also with RxJavaFX using a `Transformer`, which is essentially a custom operator you can pass to a `compose()` operator.

> Java does not have extension functions like Kotlin. But RxJava does have a `compose()` operator that you can pass a `Transformer` to, as well as a `lift()` operator to accept custom operators. Between these two methods, it is possible to create your own operators for RxJava. However, these are beyond the scope of this book. You can read about [creating your own operators in my book _Learning RxJava](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-rxjava).

Here are all the `doOnXXXFx()` operators availabe in RxKotlin. These behave exactly the same way as the `doOnXXX()` operators introduced in Chapter 2, but the action specified in the lambda will execute on the FX thread.

* `doOnNextFx()`
* `doOnErrorFx()`
* `doOnCompletedFx()`
* `doOnSubscribeFx()`
* `doOnUnsubscribeFx()`
* `doOnTerminateFx()`
* `doOnNextCountFx()`
* `doOnCompletedCountFx()`
* `doOnErrorCountFx()`

The `doOnXXXCountFx()` operators will provide a count of emissions that occurred before each of those events. They can be helpful for updating a `ProgressBar`, an incrementing `StatusBar`, or other controls that track progress.

## Parallelization

Did you know the `flatMap()` (as well as `flatMapSingle()` and `flatMapMaybe()`) is actually a concurrency tool? RxJava by default does not do parallelization, so effectively there is no way to parallelize an `Observable`. As we have seen, `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()` merely move emissions from one thread to another thread, not one thread to many threads.  However, you can leverage `flatMap()` to create several Observables parallelizing emissions on different threads.

For instance we can parallelize a (simulated) long-running process for 10 consecutive integers.

**Java**

```java
import io.reactivex.Observable;
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;

public class Launcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.range(1,10)
                .flatMap(i -> Observable.just(i)
                        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
                        .map(Launcher::runLongProcess)
                ).subscribe(i -> System.out.println("Received " +
                i + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
        );

        try {
            Thread.sleep(10000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    public static int runLongProcess(int i) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 1000));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
import io.reactivex.Observable
import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers

fun main(args: Array<String>)  {
    Observable.range(1,10)
            .flatMap {
                Observable.just(it)
                        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
                        .map { runLongProcess(it) }
            }.subscribe {
                println("Received $it on ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
            }

    Thread.sleep(15000)
}

fun runLongProcess(i: Int): Int {
    Thread.sleep(Math.random().toLong() * 1000)
    return i
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Received 1 on RxComputationScheduler-1
Received 3 on RxComputationScheduler-3
Received 5 on RxComputationScheduler-1
Received 9 on RxComputationScheduler-1
Received 4 on RxComputationScheduler-4
Received 8 on RxComputationScheduler-4
Received 2 on RxComputationScheduler-3
Received 6 on RxComputationScheduler-3
Received 7 on RxComputationScheduler-3
Received 10 on RxComputationScheduler-3
```

Your output may look different from what is above, and that is okay since nothing is deterministic when we do this sort of parallelized concurrency. But notice we have processing happening on at least three threads (RxComputationScheduler-1, 3, and 4). Threads will be assigned at random. Since each `Observable` created by an emission inside a `flatMap()` will take its own thread from the given `Scheduler`, each resulting `Observable` will indepedently process emisssions on a separate thread _within the _`flatMap()`.

It is critical to note that the `flatMap()` can fire emissions from multiple Observables inside it, all of which may be running on different threads. But to respect the `Observable` contract, it must make sure that emissions leaving the `flatMap()` towards the `Observer` are serialized in a single `Observable`. If one thread is busy pushing items out of the `flatMap()`, the other threads will leave their emissions for that occupying thread to take ownership of in a queue. This allows the benefit of concurrency without any blocking or synchronization of threads.

## Summary

In ths chapter we have learned one of the main selling points of Rxjava: concise, flexible, and composable concurrency. You can compose Observables to change concurrency policies at any time with the `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()`. This makes applications adaptable, scalable, and evolvable over long periods of time. You do not have to mess with synchronizers, semaphores, or any other low-level concurrency tools as RxJava takes care of these complexities for you.

But we are not quite done yet. As we will see in the next chapter, we can leverage concurrency to create features you might have thought impractical to put in your applications.
