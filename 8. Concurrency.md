# 8. Concurrency

Concurrency has become a critical skill in software development. Most computers and smart phones now have multiple core processors, and this means the most effective way to scale performance is to leverage all of them. For this full utilization to happen, code must explicitly be coded for multiple threads that can be worked by multiple cores.

The idea of concurrency is essentially multitasking. Multiple threads execute multiple tasks at the same time. Suppose you had some yard work to do and had three tasks: mow the lawn, trim the trees, and sweep the patio. If you are working alone, there is no way you can do all three of these tasks at the same time. You have to sequentially work on each task one-at-a-time. But if you had two friends or family members to help out, you can get done more quickly as all three of you can execute all three tasks simultaneously. In essense, each person is a thread and each chore is a task.

Even if you have less threads than tasks (such as two threads and three tasks), the two threads can tackle two of the tasks immediately. The first one to get done can then move on to the third task. This is essentially what a thread pool does. It has a fixed number of threads and is given a "queue" of tasks to do. Each thread will take a task, execute it, and then take another. "Reusing" threads and giving them a queue of tasks, rather than creating a thread for each task, is usually more efficient since threads are expensive to create and destroy.

Traditionally, concurrency is difficult to master in Java. A lot can go wrong especially with mutable variables being accessed by multiple threads. Thankfully, RxJava makes concurrency much easier and safer. When you stay within an `Observable` chain, it does not matter what thread emissions happen on (except of course Subscribers and operators affecting JavaFX UI's which need to happen on the JavaFX thread). A major selling point of RxJava is it makes concurrency trivial to compose, and this is helpful to make JavaFX UI's responsive and non-freezing.

>It is recommended to study concurrency without RxJava, just so you are aware of the "gotchas" that can happen with multithreading. Benjamin Winterberg has an [awesome online tutorial](http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/04/07/java8-concurrency-tutorial-thread-executor-examples/) walking through Java 8 concurrency. If you want deep knowlege in Java concurrnecy, [Java Concurrency in Practice](http://jcip.net/) is an involved but very informative book.

## Using `subscribeOn()`

By default, for a given `Observable` chain, the thread that calls the `subscribe()` method is the thread the `Observable` sends emissions on. For instance, a simple subscription to an `Observable` inside a `main()` method will fire the emissions on the `main` daemon thread.

**Java**

```java
public class JavaLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.range(1,5)
                    .subscribe(i ->
                            System.out.println("Receiving " + i + " on thread "
                                    + Thread.currentThread().getName())
                    );
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    Observable.range(1,5)
        .subscribe { println("Receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Receiving 1 on thread main
Receiving 2 on thread main
Receiving 3 on thread main
Receiving 4 on thread main
Receiving 5 on thread main
```

However, we can easily switch these emissions to happen on another thread using `subscribeOn()`. We can pass a `Scheduler` as an argument which specifies where it gets a thread from. In this case, we can pass `subscribeOn()` an argument of `Schedulers.newThread()`, so it will execute on a new thread for each `Subscriber`.

**Java**

```java
public class JavaLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.range(1,5)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
            .subscribe(i ->
                    System.out.println("Receiving " + i + " on thread "
                            + Thread.currentThread().getName())
            );

        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    Observable.range(1,5)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
        .subscribe { println("Receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
```


This way we can declare our `Observable` chain and a `Subscriber`, but then immediately move on without waiting for the emissions to finish. Those are now happening on a new thread named `RxNewThreadScheduler-1`. Notice too we have to call `TimUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)` to make the `main` thread sleep for 3 seconds. This gives our `Observable` a chance to fire all emissions before the program exits, but you should not have to do this with a JavaFX application since it will indefinitely stay alive.

A critical behavior to note here is that _all_ emissions are happening _sequentially_ on a single `RxNewThreadScheduler-1` thread. Emissions are strictly happening one-after-the-other on a single thread and not racing to call `onNext()` for each step. If this did occur, it would break the [`Observable` contract](http://reactivex.io/documentation/contract.html). In other words, RxJava is not parallel! But we will cover some concurrency tricks with `flatMap()` later to get parallelization without breaking the `Observable` contract.

`subscribeOn()` can be declared anywhere in the `Observable` chain, and it will communicate all the way up to the source what thread to fire emissions on. If you declare multiple `subscribeOn()` operators in a chain, the left-most one (closest to the source) will win. Later we will cover the `observeOn()` which can switch emissions to a different thread in the middle of the chain.

### Pooling Threads: Choosing a Scheduler

In reality, you should be conservative about using `Schedulers.newThread()` as it creates a new thread for each `Subscriber`. You will notice that if we attach multiple Subscribers to this `Observable`, we are unsurprisingly going to create a new thread for each `Subscriber`.

**Java**

```java
public class JavaLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread());

        //Subscriber 1
        source.subscribe(i ->
                System.out.println("Subscriber 1 receiving " + i + " on thread "
                        + Thread.currentThread().getName())
        );

        //Subscriber 2
        source.subscribe(i ->
                System.out.println("Subscriber 2 receiving " + i + " on thread "
                        + Thread.currentThread().getName())
        );

        try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val source = Observable.range(1,5)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())

    //Subscriber 1
    source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 1 receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    //Subscriber 2
    source.subscribe { println("Subscriber 2 receiving $it on thread ${Thread.currentThread().name}") }

    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3)
}
```

**OUTPUT:**

```
Subscriber 2 receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Subscriber 1 receiving 1 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Subscriber 2 receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Subscriber 1 receiving 2 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Subscriber 2 receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Subscriber 1 receiving 3 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Subscriber 2 receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Subscriber 1 receiving 4 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
Subscriber 2 receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-2
Subscriber 1 receiving 5 on thread RxNewThreadScheduler-1
```
Now we have two threads, `RxNewThreadScheduler-1` and `RxNewThreadScheduler-2`. What if we had 100, or even 1000 Subscribers! This can easily happen if you are flatMapping to hundreds or thousands of Observables!  Threads are very expensive and can tax your machine memory and CPU-wise, so we want to constrain the number of threads.

The most effective way to keep thread creation under control is to "reuse" threads, and you can do this with the different `Schedulers`. A `Scheduler` is RxJava's equivalent to [Java's standard `Executor`](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-util-concurrent/executorservice.html), and you can indeed create your own `Scheduler` by passing an `Executor` to the `Schedulers.from()` factory. But for most cases, it is better to use RxJava's standard `Schedulers` as they are optimized to be conservative and efficient for most cases.

#### Computation

If you are doing computation-intensive operations, you will likely want to use `Schedulers.computation()` which will maintain a conservative number of threads to keep the CPU from being taxed.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation());
```

#### IO

If you are doing a lot of IO-related tasks, like sending web service requests or database queries, these are much less taxing on the CPU and threads can be created more liberally. `Schedulers.io()` is suited for this kind of work. It will add and remove threads depending on how much work is being thrown at it at a given time. But be careful! As a rule-of-thumb, assume it will create a new thread for each task even if it does reuse threads.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io());
```

#### Immediate

The `Schedulers.immediate()` is the default `Scheduler`, and it will work execute work on the immediate thread declaring the `Subscriber`.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate());
```

You will likely not use this `Scheduler` very often since it is used by default anyway.

#### Trampoline

An interesting `Scheduler` is the `Schedulers.trampoline()`. It will schedule the emissions to happen on the immediate thread, but allow the immediate thread to finish its current task first. In other words, this defers execution of the emissions but will fire them the moment the current thread declaring the subscription is no longer busy.

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.trampoline());
```

#### JavaFX Scheduler

Finally, the `JavaFxScheduler` is packaged with the RxJavaFX library. It executes the emissions on the JavaFX thread so they can safely make modifications to a UI. It uses a trampoline policy against the JavaFX thread, making it highly resilient and prevents hangups and starvation on the JavaFX thread.

The JavaFX Scheduler is not in the `Schedulers` class, but rather is stored as a singleton in its own class. You can call it like below:

```java
Observable<Integer> source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOn(JavaFxScheduler.getInstance());
```

In Kotlin, The RxKotlinFX library can save you some boilerplate by using an extension function instead.

```kotlin
val source = Observable.range(1,5)
    .subscribeOnFx()
```

At the time of writing, all RxJavaFX/RxKotlinFX factories already emit on the `JavaFxScheduler`. Therefore, declaring a `subscribeOn()` against these sources will have no affect. You will need to leverage `observeOn()` to switch to another thread later in the chain, which we will cover shortly.


**Java**

```java
Button button = new Button("Press me");

JavaFxObservable.fromActionEvents(button)
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // has no effect
        .subscribe(ae -> System.out.println("You clicked me!"));
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
val button = Button("Press me")

button.actionEvents()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // has no effect
        .subscribe { println("You clicked me!") }
```


### Interval Sources

While we are talking about concurrency, it is worth mentioning there are other factories that already emit on a specific `Scheduler`. For instance, there are factories in both RxJava and JavaFX to emit at a specified time interval.

In RxJava, there is an `Observable.interval()` that will emit a consecutive `long` for every specified interval based on a specified number of `TimeUnit`s. By default, this runs on the `Schedulers.computation()` unless you specify a different one as a third argument.

Here is an application that will increment a `Label` every second (Figure 8.1).

**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        Label label = new Label();

        Observable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS, JavaFxScheduler.getInstance())
                .map(l -> l.toString())
                .subscribe(label::setText);

        root.getChildren().add(label);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.setMinWidth(60);
        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        minWidth = 60.0

        label {
            Observable.interval(1,TimeUnit.SECONDS, JavaFxScheduler.getInstance())
                .map { it.toString() }
                .subscribe { text = it }
        }
    }
}


```

**OUTPUT:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

> You can also use `JavaFxScheduler.interval()` to pass a `Duration` instead of a `TimeUnit`, and schedule on the JavaFX thread out-of-the-box.


## Using `observeOn()`

A lot of folks get confused by the difference between `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()`, but the distinction is quite simple. A `subsribeOn()` instructs the source `Observable` what thread to emit items on. However, the `observeOn()` switches emissions to a different thread at that point in the chain.

In JavaFX, the most common useage of `observeOn()` is to put items back on the JavaFX thread after a compution or IO operation finishes from another thread. Say you wanted to import some expensive data on `Schedulers.io()` and collect it in a `List`, and once it is ready you want to move that `List` emission to the JavaFX thread to feed a `ListView`? That is perfectly doable with an `observeOn()` (Figure 8.2).


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.getInstance())
                .subscribe(list -> listView.getItems().setAll(list));

        root.getChildren().add(listView);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        listview<String> {
            Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOnFx()
                .subscribe { items.setAll(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.2**

![](http://i.imgur.com/aCJeQ2X.png)

The five Strings are emitted and collected into a `List` on a `Schedulers.io()` thread. But immediately after the `toList()` is an `observeOn()` that takes that `List` and emits it on the JavaFX Scheduler. The placement of the `subscribeOn()` does not matter as it will always instruct the source no matter where it is at. But the placement of the `observeOn()` is key. It switches to a different thread _at that point in the Observable chain_.

This all happens a bit too fast to see this occuring, so let's emulate a long-running database query or request. Use the `delay()` operator to delay the emissions by 3 seconds. Note it subscribes on the `Schedulers.computation()` by default. Having a `subscribeOn()` no longer has any effect. But we can pass the `Schedulers.io()` as a third argument to make it use an IO thread instead (Figure 8.3).


**Java**

```java
public final class JavaFxApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {

        VBox root = new VBox();

        ListView<String> listView = new ListView<>();

        Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                .delay(3,TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOn(JavaFxScheduler.getInstance())
                .subscribe(list -> listView.getItems().setAll(list));

        root.getChildren().add(listView);

        stage.setScene(new Scene(root));

        stage.show();
    }
}
```

**Kotlin**

```kotlin
class MyView : View("My View") {

    override val root = vbox {

        listview<String> {
            Observable.just("Alpha","Beta","Gamma","Delta","Epsilon")
                .delay(3,TimeUnit.SECONDS, Schedulers.io())
                .toList()
                .observeOnFx()
                .subscribe { items.setAll(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

**Figure 8.3**
![](http://i.imgur.com/HWH8Kit.png) ![](http://i.imgur.com/DaEOAZZ.png)

In Figure 8.3, notice that our UI is empty for 3 seconds before it is finally populated. The data import and collecting into a `List` happens on the IO thread, and then it is safely emitted on the JavaFX thread where it is populated into the `List`. In a real-world case, the JavaFX thread does not hold up the UI from displaying due to this operation keeping it busy. If we had more controls we would see the UI is completely interactive as well during this background operation.
