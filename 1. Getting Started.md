# 1. Getting Started

Reactive programming is about composing events and data together, and treating them identically. This idea of "events are data, and data are events" is powerful, and because UI's often have to coordinate both it is the perfect place to learn and apply reactive programming. For this reason, this book will teach RxJava from a JavaFX perspective and assume no prior RxJava knowledge. If you already have experience with RxJava, you are welcome to skip the next chapter.

I would highly recommend being familiar with JavaFX (or TornadoFX) before starting this book. _[Mastering JavaFX 8 Controls_ \(Hendrik Ebbers\) and _Pro JavaFX 8_ \(James Weaver and Weiqi Gao\) are excellent books to learn JavaFX. If you are interested in leveraging JavaFX with the [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) language, check out the [TornadoFX Guide](http://tornadofx.io/guide) written by Edvin Syse and Thomas Nield (yours truly). I will explain why this book shows examples in both the Java and Kotlin languages shortly. For now, let us explore the benefits of using RxJava with JavaFX.

## Why Use RxJava with JavaFX?

As stated earlier, reactive programming can equalize events and data by treating them the same way. This is a powerful idea with seemingly endless practical use cases. JavaFX provides many hooks that can easily be made reactive. There are many reactive libraries, from [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Sodium](https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium) to [ReactFX]((https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX). But RxJava really hit on something, especially with its simple handling of concurrency, extensibility, and rich ecosystem of third party libraries. It has taken the Android community by storm and continues to make reactive programming a go-to tool to meet modern user demands.

[RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX) is a lightweight but comprehensive library to plug JavaFX components into RxJava, and vice versa. This is what this book will cover. Some folks reading this may ask "Why not use [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX)? Why do we need a second reactive framework for JavaFX when that one is perfectly fine?" ReactFX is an excellent reactive framework made by Tomas Mikula, and you can read more about my experiences with it in the Preface. But the TL;DR is this: **ReactFX encourages keeping all operations on the JavaFX thread, while RxJava embraces full-blown concurrency. On top of that, RxJava also has a rich ecosystem of extensible libraries \(e.g. **[**RxJava-JDBC**](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc)**, while ReactFX focuses solely on JavaFX events.** ReactFX and RxJavaFX simply have different scopes and goals.

RxJava has a rapidly growing and active community. The creators and maintainers of RxJava do an awesome job of answering questions and being responsive to developers of all skill levels. Reactive programming has enabled an exciting new domain filled with new ideas, practical applications, and constant discovery. RxJava is one of the many [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) API's standardized across many programming languages. Speaking of other languages, let us talk about Kotlin.

## Using Kotlin (Optional)

This book will present examples in two languages: Java and Kotlin. If you are not familiar, [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) is a new JVM language created by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/), the company behind Intellij IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, and several other IDE's and tools. JetBrains believed they could be more productive by creating a new language that emphasized pragmatism and industry over convention. After 5 years of developing and testing, Kotlin 1.0 was released in February 2016 to fulfill this need. A year later Kotlin 1.1 was released with more practical (but tightly-scoped) features.

If you have never checked out Kotlin, I would higly recommend [giving it a look](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). It is an intuitive language that only takes a few hours for a Java developer to learn. The reason I present Kotlin in this book is because it created a unique opportunity on the JavaFX front. Towards the end of Kotlin's beta, Edvin Syse released [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx), a lightweight Kotlin library that significantly streamlines development of JavaFX applications.

For instance, with TornadoFX you can create an entire `TableView` using just the Kotlin code below:

```kotlin
tableview<Person> {
    column("ID", Person::id)
    column("Name", Person::name)
    column("Birthday", Person::birthday)
    column("Age", Person::age)
}
```

I had the privilege of joining Edvin's project not long after TornadoFX's release, and the core team has created a phenomenal JavaFX suite of features enabled by the Kotlin language. I would highly recommend giving the [TornadoFX Guide](https://edvin.gitbooks.io/tornadofx-guide/content/) a look to learn more.

There is a Kotlin extension of the RxJavaFX library called [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX). It wraps Kotlin extension functions around RxJavaFX and includes some additional operators. The Kotlin versions of examples will use this library, and will also use TornadoFX. Using this stack may add a few more dependencies to your project, but the amount of value it adds through abstraction and productivity may make it worthwhile!

If you are not interested in Kotlin, no worries! The Java version of code samples will be always be presented first and you can ignore the Kotlin ones.

## Setting Up

Currently, RxJavaFX and RxKotlinFX support both RxJava 1.x and RxJava 2.x \(and aligned with their own respectiveX 1.x and 2.x versions\). RxJava 2.x brings a number of large changes to RxJava, and this is the version that the guide will cover.

You should prefer RxJava 2.x because RxJava 1.x support will discontinue early 2018.

### Java

To setup RxJavaFX 2.x for Java, use the Gradle or Maven configuration below where `x.y.z` is the version number you want to specify.

**Gradle**

```
compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:x.y.z'
```

**Maven**

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex.rxjava2</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjavafx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### Kotlin

If you are using Kotlin, you will want to use RxKotlinFX instead of RxJavaFX.  Make sure you have configured  [Maven](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html) or [Gradle](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) to use a [Kotlin configuration](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html), and include the dependencies below. Note the `x.y.z` is where you put the targeted version number, and I included TornadoFX and RxKotlin as dependencies since the examples will use them.

**Gradle**

    compile 'com.github.thomasnield:rxkotlinfx:x.y.z'
    compile 'no.tornado:tornadofx:x.y.z`
    compile 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxkotlin:x.y.z'

**Maven**

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thomasnield</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxkotlinfx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
    <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxkotlin</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

_Figure 1.1_. shows a Venn diagram showing the stack of technologies typically used to built a reactive JavaFX application with Kotlin. The overlaps indicate that library is used to interoperate between the 3 domains: JavaFX, RxJava and Kotlin

### Summary

In this chapter we got a high level overview of reactive programming and the role RxJavaFX plays in connecting JavaFX and RxJava together. There was also an explanation why Kotlin is presented alongside Java in this book, and why both RxKotlinFX and TornadoFX are compelling options when building JavaFX applications. You can go through this book completely ignoring the Kotlin examples if you like.

In the next chapter we will cover the fundamentals of RxJava, and do it from a JavaFX perspective. If you are already experienced with RxJava, you are welcome to skip this chapter. But if you have been looking for a practical domain to apply RxJava, read on!
