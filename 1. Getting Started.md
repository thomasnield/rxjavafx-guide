# 1. Getting Started

Reactive programming is about composing events and data together, and treating them the same. This idea of "events are data, and data are events" is a powerful one. Because UI's often have to coordinate events and data, it is the perfect place to apply reactive programming. Actually, not just *apply* but even *learn*. For this reason, this book will teach RxJava from a JavaFX perspective and assume no prior RxJava knowledge. If you already have experience with RxJava, you are welcome to skip the next chapter. 

I would highly recommend being familiar with JavaFX before starting this book. *Mastering JavaFX 8 Controls*  (Hendrik Ebbers) and *Pro JavaFX 8* (James Weaver and Weiqi Gao) are excellent books to learn JavaFX. If you are interested in leveraging JavaFX with the [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) languagRxe, check out the [TornadoFX Guide](https://edvin.gitbooks.io/tornadofx-guide/content/) written by the author of this book, Thomas Nield, as well as Edvin Syse. I will explain why this book uses examples in both Java and Kotlin shortly. For now, let's explore the question "Why even use RxJava with JavaFX?".

## Why Use RxJava with JavaFX? 

As stated earlier, reactive programming can equalize events and data by treating them the same way. JavaFX provides many hooks that can easily be plugged into and made reactive. There are many reactive libraries, from [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Sodium](https://github.com/SodiumFRP/sodium) to [ReactFX]((https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX)). But RxJava really hit on something, with its simple handling of concurrency and rich ecosystem of third party libraries. RxJava has taken the Android community by storm and continues to make reactive programming an everyday tool and not just an academic idea.

[RxJavaFX](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaFX) is a lightweight but comprehensive library to plug JavaFX components into RxJava, and vice versa. This is what this book will cover. Some folks reading this may ask "Why not use [ReactFX](https://github.com/TomasMikula/ReactFX)? Why do we need a second reactive framework for JavaFX when that one is perfectly fine?" ReactFX is an excellent reactive framework made by Tomas Mikula, and you can read more about my experiences with it in the preface. But the TL;DR is this: **ReactFX encourages keeping all operations on the JavaFX thread, while RxJava embraces full-blown concurrency. RxJava also has a rich ecosystem of extensible libraries (e.g. [RxJava-JDBC](https://github.com/davidmoten/rxjava-jdbc)), while ReactFX focuses solely on JavaFX events.** ReactFX and RxJavaFX simply have different goals, and I encourage being familiar with both. When you can help it, never limit yourself to knowing one technology in a domain. 

Anyway, RxJava has a rapidly growing and active community. The creators and maintainers of RxJava do an awesome job of answering questions and being responsive to developers of all levels. Reactive programming has enabled an exciting new domain filled with ideas, creativity, and constant discovery. RxJava is one of the many [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) API's standardized across most common programming platforms.  Speaking of other languages, let's talk about Kotlin. 

## Using Kotlin (Optional)

This book will present examples in two languages: Java and Kotlin. If you are not familiar, [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) is a new JVM language created by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/), the company behind Intellij IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, and probably a dozen other IDE's. JetBrains believed they could be more productive by creating a new language that emphasized pragmatism over convention. After 5 years of developing and testing, Kotlin 1.0 was released in February 2016. 

If you have never checked out Kotlin, I would higly recommend [giving it a look](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). It is an intuitive language that only takes a few hours for a moderately-experienced Java developer to learn. The reason I bring Kotlin  up in this book is because it created a unique opportunity on the JavaFX front. Towards the end of Kotlin's beta, Edvin Syse released [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx), a lightweight Kotlin library that significantly streamlines development of JavaFX applications. I have had the privilege of joining Edvin's project not long after its release, and the core team have made some phenomenal features. I would highly recommend giving the [TornadoFX Guide](https://edvin.gitbooks.io/tornadofx-guide/content/) a look if you are curious to learn about it (Full disclosure: I wrote a lot of that too with Edvin). TornadoFX has done for JavaFX what [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko) did for Android.

There is a Kotlin extension of the RxJavaFX library called [RxKotlinFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/RxKotlinFX). It wraps Kotlin extension functions around RxJavaFX and includes some additional operators. The Kotlin versions of examples will use this library. The examples may also use TornadoFX, and I will label this clearly when that is the case. 

If you are not interested in Kotlin, no worries! The Java version of code samples will be always be presented first. Anyway, let's get going!

## Setting Up

### Java

To setup RxJavaFX for Java, use the Gradle or Maven configuration below where `x.y.z` is the version number you want to specify. 

**Gradle**
```
compile 'io.reactivex:rxjavafx:0.1.4'
```

**Maven**
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjavafx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### Kotlin

If you are using Kotlin, you will want to use RxKotlinFX instead of RxJavaFX.  Make sure you have configured  [Maven](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html) or [Gradle](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) to use a [Kotlin configuration](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) , and include the dependencies below. Note the `x.y.z` is where you put the targeted version number, and I included TornadoFX as a dependency since the examples will use it. 

Be sure to also include TornadoFX and RxKotlin, a Kotlin wrapper library for RxJava. 

**Gradle**
```
compile 'com.github.thomasnield:rxkotlinfx:x.y.z'
compile 'no.tornado:tornadofx:x.y.z`
compile 'io.reactivex:rxkotlin:x.y.z'
```

**Maven**
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thomasnield</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxkotlinfx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>no.tornado</groupId>
    <artifactId>tornadofx</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxkotlin</artifactId>
    <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

### Summary

In this chapter we got a quick exposure of reactive programming and the role RxJavaFX plays in connecting JavaFX and RxJava together. There was also an explanation why Kotlin is presented alongside Java in this book, and why both RxKotlinFX and TornadoFX are compelling options when building JavaFX applications with Kotlin. You can go through this book completely ignoring the Kotlin examples if you like. 

In the next chapter we will cover the fundamentals of RxJava, and do it from a JavaFX perspective. If you are already experienced with RxJava you are welcome to skip this chapter. But if you have been looking for a practical domain to apply RxJava, read on!
